# Learning Graph Generator Session Log

**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Course:** Personal Finance for Young Adults (2025-2026)

## Steps Completed

### Step 0: Setup
- Verified docs directory and mkdocs.yml exist
- Learning-graph directory already present
- Copied Python scripts from skill package

### Step 1: Course Description Quality Assessment
- Quality score found in metadata: **100/100**
- Skipped full assessment (score above 85 threshold)

### Step 2: Generate Concept Labels
- Generated **205 concepts** covering all 22 chapters
- All labels in Title Case, under 32 characters
- Saved to `concept-list.md`

### Step 3: Generate Dependency Graph
- Created CSV with 205 concepts and 366 dependency edges
- Fixed circular dependencies: 401(k)/Employer Match, HSA/Triple Tax Advantage, Index Fund/S&P 500, Tax Refund/Tax Filing, Diversification/Asset Allocation
- Format: ConceptID, ConceptLabel, Dependencies (pipe-delimited), TaxonomyID
- Saved to `learning-graph.csv`

### Step 4: Quality Validation
- Used `analyze-graph.py` (from skill package)
- Results: 205 concepts, 1 connected component, 0 cycles, max chain length 12
- 113 orphaned nodes (expected leaf concepts)
- Quality score: 85/100
- Saved to `quality-metrics.md`

### Step 5: Create Concept Taxonomy
- Created 22 taxonomy categories (one per chapter)
- Saved to `concept-taxonomy.md`

### Step 5b: Create Taxonomy Names JSON
- Created `taxonomy-names.json` with all 22 taxonomy ID to name mappings
- All names are human-readable (e.g., "FOUND" → "Foundation Concepts")

### Step 6: Add Taxonomy to CSV
- Taxonomy IDs were included during initial CSV generation in Step 3
- All 205 concepts have assigned TaxonomyIDs

### Step 7: Create Metadata JSON
- Created `metadata.json` with Dublin Core fields
- Title, description, creator, date, version, format, schema, license

### Step 8: Create Groups Section
- Groups auto-generated by csv-to-json.py from taxonomy data

### Step 9: Generate Complete Learning Graph JSON
- Used `csv-to-json.py` v0.03 with all config files
- Command: `python csv-to-json.py learning-graph.csv learning-graph.json color-config.json metadata.json taxonomy-names.json`
- Result: 22 groups, 205 nodes, 366 edges, 1 foundational concept
- Saved to `learning-graph.json`

### Step 10: Taxonomy Distribution Report
- Used `taxonomy-distribution.py` (from skill package)
- 22 categories, average 9.3 concepts per category
- No over-represented categories (all under 30%)
- 6 slightly under-represented categories (under 3%)
- Saved to `taxonomy-distribution.md`

### Step 11: Create Index Page
- Updated `index.md` with current statistics

### Step 12: Session Log
- This file
