### Strengths for Concept Generation

2. **52 learning outcomes** across all Bloom's levels ensure diverse concept types (foundational definitions, procedural knowledge, analytical frameworks, evaluative criteria, creative syntheses)
3. **Modern relevance**: Topics like cryptocurrency, robo-advisors, gig economy, FIRE movement, and digital estate planning provide contemporary concepts
4. **Progressive complexity**: Clear progression from basics (mindset, budgeting) through intermediate (investing, retirement) to advanced (FIRE, estate planning, generational wealth) supports layered concept dependencies
5. **Practical focus**: Many outcomes reference specific tools (Fidelity, Vanguard, YNAB), methods (avalanche, snowball, dollar-cost averaging), and strategies that map to discrete concepts
6. **Real numbers**: Contribution limits, tax brackets, APY rates, and salary examples provide concrete concepts
7. **Action-oriented**: Every chapter requires "What To Do This Week" action items, ensuring procedural concepts
