# FAQ Coverage Gaps

**Date:** 2026-02-18

## Summary

The current FAQ covers 114 of 205 concepts from the learning graph, achieving 55.6% coverage. This report identifies the 91 uncovered concepts, classifies them by priority, and recommends which gaps to address first. Critical gaps represent foundational concepts that underpin many others in the curriculum — leaving these unanswered creates structural holes in the reader's understanding. Medium priority gaps address important but more targeted topics, while low priority gaps are specialized or leaf-level concepts that serve narrower audiences. Addressing the top critical and medium gaps would raise FAQ coverage to approximately 80% and significantly improve the resource's usefulness as a standalone reference.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 — Address Critical Gaps Immediately

The 22 critical gaps represent foundational knowledge that readers need before they can benefit from many other FAQ answers. Recommended order of resolution:

1. **Money Mindset and Money Scripts** (Ch. 1) — These set the psychological frame for the entire book and are referenced throughout.
2. **Financial Goals and SMART Goals** (Ch. 1) — Almost every action item in the book assumes the reader can set and track goals.
3. **Needs vs Wants and Expense Tracking** (Ch. 2) — Core mechanics of the budgeting chapter cannot be applied without these concepts.
4. **Risk vs Return, Time Value of Money, Asset Allocation** (Ch. 8) — These three form the conceptual backbone of all investing content.
5. **Marginal Tax Rate, Tax Deductions, Tax-Advantaged Accounts** (Ch. 7) — Prerequisite for understanding Roth IRA, 401(k), and HSA content.
6. **Simple Interest and Minimum Payment Trap** (Ch. 6) — Essential for readers dealing with credit card or loan debt.
7. **Three Month / Six Month Expenses and Financial Safety Net** (Ch. 5) — Emergency fund sizing is one of the most common reader questions.
8. **Loss Aversion and Anchoring Bias** (Ch. 18) — Behavioral concepts that explain why readers fail to execute good plans.

### Priority 2 — Close Medium Gaps in High-Traffic Chapters

Focus next on chapters with the most medium-priority gaps:

- **Chapter 7 (Taxes):** Five medium gaps (W-2, W-4, 1099, State Income Tax, Tax Refund) — these are highly searchable, seasonal topics.
- **Chapter 9 (Stock Market):** Five medium gaps (Dow Jones, Market Cap, Bull/Bear, Stock Exchange, Buy and Hold) — frequently asked by new investors.
- **Chapter 10 (Roth IRA):** Five medium gaps (Contribution Limits, Tax-Deferred Growth, RMDs, Target Date Fund, Three-Fund Portfolio).
- **Chapter 18 (Behavioral Finance & Scams):** Five medium gaps (Confirmation Bias, Financial Scams, Phishing, Identity Theft, Social Media Misinfo) — high relevance for young adults.

### Priority 3 — Address Low Priority Gaps as Supplementary Content

The five cryptocurrency-related low-priority gaps (Blockchain, Crypto Volatility, Portfolio Allocation, NFTs, Crypto Exchanges) can be consolidated into a single extended FAQ answer or a dedicated "Crypto FAQ" section rather than individual entries.

### Structural Recommendation

Consider organizing FAQ answers by chapter to match the book's structure. Readers progressing through the book should be able to find answers to chapter-specific questions without searching the entire FAQ. A chapter-indexed FAQ would also make coverage gaps visible at a glance during maintenance.
