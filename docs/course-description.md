# Personal Finance for Young Adults (2025-2026)

## Course Overview

Personal Finance for Young Adults is a comprehensive, 22-chapter guide designed to empower individuals aged 18-30 with the essential financial knowledge and skills needed to build a secure financial future in the modern economy. This textbook addresses the unique financial challenges facing today's young adults, including student loan debt, rising housing costs, gig economy employment, cryptocurrency investments, and the importance of early retirement planning. Through practical examples with real dollar amounts, interactive MicroSim calculators, and evidence-based strategies, students will learn to make informed financial decisions that align with their personal values and long-term goals.

The course takes a holistic approach to personal finance, covering everything from financial mindset and budgeting to advanced topics like the FIRE movement, estate planning, and building generational wealth. With the landscape of personal finance constantly evolving due to technological innovations like digital banking, robo-advisors, and blockchain technology, this textbook ensures students are prepared to navigate both traditional and emerging financial systems. Real-world examples feature relatable scenarios with actual numbers, such as managing finances on a $2,500/month after-tax salary, paying off $30,000 in student loans while contributing to a Roth IRA, and making smart decisions about major purchases.

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for young adults aged 18-30 who are beginning their financial independence journey. Many have never been taught basic money skills. The ideal student may be a recent high school graduate, current college student, recent graduate entering the workforce, or young professional looking to improve their financial literacy. No prior knowledge of finance or economics is required - the course starts with fundamental concepts and builds progressively to more advanced topics.

- Anyone looking to build wealth and achieve financial independence
- Young professionals seeking to maximize their earning and saving potential

1. **Priority 1**: Build a $1,000 starter emergency fund
2. **Priority 2**: Get your full employer 401(k) match (it's free money)
3. **Priority 3**: Pay off high-interest debt (over 7% interest rate)
4. **Priority 4**: Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses
5. **Priority 5**: Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)
6. **Priority 6**: Invest additional money in low-cost index funds
7. **Priority 7**: Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7% interest rate)
