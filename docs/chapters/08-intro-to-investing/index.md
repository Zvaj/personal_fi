## Introduction: Why Investing Is Not Optional

Here is a truth that will change how you think about money: saving alone will never make you wealthy. A savings account keeps your money safe, but investing is what makes it grow.

Let us look at the numbers. Suppose you have $10,000 today and you do not add another dollar to it for 30 years.

- **In a savings account at 4.5% APY**: your $10,000 grows to about **$37,453**
- **Invested in a diversified stock index fund averaging 10% per year**: your $10,000 grows to about **$174,494**

That is not a typo. The invested money grows to nearly five times more than the saved money over the same period, starting with the exact same amount. The difference is $137,041 -- and all you had to do was put your money in a different place.

\[
\$10{,}000 \times (1.10)^{30} = \$174{,}494
\]

\[
\$10{,}000 \times (1.045)^{30} = \$37{,}453
\]

This is why investing is not some advanced strategy for rich people. It is the single most powerful tool ordinary people have for building real wealth. And the earlier you start, the more dramatic the results.

!!! tip "Where Does Investing Fit in Your Priorities?"
    Investing is Priority #5 and #6 in your financial plan. Before you invest, make sure you have: (1) your $1,000 starter emergency fund, (2) your full employer 401(k) match, (3) high-interest debt above 7% paid off, and (4) your emergency fund built to 3-6 months. Once those are handled, you are ready to invest aggressively.

## What Is Investing?

**Investing** means putting your money into something that you expect will grow in value over time, so you end up with more money than you started with. When you invest, you are buying ownership in businesses, lending money to governments or corporations, or purchasing other assets that generate returns.

The key difference between saving and investing is this: saving preserves your money, while investing grows it. A savings account is like parking your car in a garage. Investing is like putting your car to work as a rideshare vehicle -- it is out there earning money for you.

Of course, investing comes with risk. Your investments can lose value, sometimes dramatically. A savings account will never show a negative balance. But over long periods of time (10 years or more), the stock market has historically always recovered from downturns and delivered strong positive returns. That is why investing works best when you start early and stay patient.

## The Time Value of Money and Why Starting Early Matters

The **time value of money** is a simple but powerful idea: a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. Why? Because a dollar today can be invested and earn returns, making it worth more tomorrow.

This concept is the engine behind everything in this chapter. It is why a 22-year-old who invests $200 per month will end up with far more money at retirement than a 35-year-old who invests $400 per month. Time is the most valuable ingredient in investing, and you cannot buy more of it.

Here is a comparison that makes this concrete. Meet two investors:

- **Priya** starts investing $200/month at age 22 and stops adding money at age 32 (10 years of contributions, $24,000 total invested)
- **Marcus** starts investing $200/month at age 32 and keeps going until age 62 (30 years of contributions, $72,000 total invested)

Assuming both earn 10% average annual returns:

- **Priya at age 62**: approximately **$556,000** (invested $24,000)
- **Marcus at age 62**: approximately **$452,000** (invested $72,000)

Priya invested one-third of the money Marcus did, stopped 30 years earlier, and still ended up with more. That is the time value of money in action. Those first 10 years of compounding gave her money decades to grow.

The lesson is clear: the best time to start investing was yesterday. The second-best time is today.

## Inflation and Purchasing Power: The Hidden Tax on Your Savings

Before we dive into investment types, you need to understand the enemy: **inflation**.

**Inflation** is the gradual increase in prices over time. A cup of coffee that cost $1.00 in 2000 costs about $2.50 today. A movie ticket that was $5 is now $12. Prices go up over time because the value of each dollar slowly decreases.

**Purchasing power** is what your money can actually buy. When inflation rises, your purchasing power drops. If you have $1,000 in a jar and inflation averages 3% per year, your money can buy about 3% less stuff each year. After 10 years, that $1,000 only has the purchasing power of about $744 in today's dollars. You did not spend a cent, but you lost over $250 in real value.

This is why a regular savings account at 0.05% APY is actually losing money in real terms. Even a high-yield savings account at 4.5% barely stays ahead of inflation. Investing in assets that grow at 7-10% per year is how you actually build wealth that outpaces inflation over the long run.

| Where You Keep Money | Typical Return | Inflation (avg 3%) | Real Return (After Inflation) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Under the mattress | 0% | -3% | **-3% (losing money)** |
| Regular savings account | 0.05% | -3% | **-2.95% (losing money)** |
| High-yield savings account | 4.5% | -3% | **+1.5% (barely growing)** |
| Bond index fund | 4-5% | -3% | **+1-2% (modest growth)** |
| Stock index fund (long-term avg) | 10% | -3% | **+7% (real wealth building)** |

The bottom line: keeping all your money in savings is not "playing it safe." It is guaranteeing that your money loses value over time. Investing is how you fight back against inflation.

## Risk vs. Return: The Fundamental Trade-Off

**Risk vs. return** is the most important concept in investing. It means this: the more potential return an investment offers, the more risk you take on. There is no such thing as a high-return, no-risk investment. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying or selling something.

Think of it like a spectrum. On one end, you have a savings account: extremely safe, but very low returns. On the other end, you have something like cryptocurrency or individual startup stocks: potentially huge returns, but you could lose everything.

#### Diagram: Risk vs. Return Spectrum

```

</details>

The good news: you do not have to pick one end of the spectrum. The goal is to find the right balance based on your age, goals, and comfort level. For most young adults with decades until retirement, stock index funds hit the sweet spot -- strong long-term returns with risk that shrinks the longer you stay invested.

!!! note "Risk Shrinks Over Time"
    The stock market dropped about 34% during the COVID crash of March 2020. Scary, right? But if you stayed invested, you would have recovered all those losses within about five months. Over any 20-year period in U.S. stock market history, there has never been a negative return. Time is your greatest protection against risk.

## The Building Blocks: Investment Types Explained

Now let us break down the five main investment types you will encounter. Think of these as ingredients -- you will mix them together to build your **portfolio** (the complete collection of all your investments).

### Stocks

A **stock** is a tiny piece of ownership in a company. When you buy a share of Apple stock, you literally own a small fraction of Apple. If Apple does well and grows, your share becomes more valuable. If Apple struggles, your share loses value.

Stocks have historically delivered the highest average returns of any major asset class -- about 10% per year on average for the U.S. stock market over the past century. But individual stocks are volatile. A single company can drop 50% or go bankrupt entirely. That is why we do not recommend putting all your money in individual stocks, especially as a beginner.

### Bonds

A **bond** is essentially a loan you make to a government or corporation. When you buy a bond, you are lending your money for a set period of time, and the borrower pays you interest in return. When the bond matures (reaches its end date), you get your original money back.

Bonds are generally safer and more predictable than stocks, but they deliver lower returns. Think of bonds as the steady, reliable part of your portfolio. They are not exciting, but they cushion the blow when the stock market drops.

### Mutual Funds

A **mutual fund** is a pool of money collected from many investors and managed by a professional fund manager. The manager uses that pool to buy a collection of stocks, bonds, or other investments. When you buy into a mutual fund, you instantly own a small piece of everything in that pool.

The advantage is instant diversification (you own many investments instead of just one). The downside is that mutual funds often charge higher fees because you are paying for the manager's expertise. You can typically only buy or sell mutual fund shares at the end of the trading day.

### Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

An **exchange-traded fund (ETF)** is similar to a mutual fund -- it holds a collection of investments bundled together. The key difference is that ETFs trade on the stock exchange just like individual stocks, meaning you can buy and sell them throughout the day at market prices.

ETFs often have lower fees than mutual funds, and many brokerages let you buy them with no commission (no fee per trade). For beginners, ETFs are usually the easiest and cheapest way to start investing.

### Index Funds: The Recommended Approach

An **index fund** is a type of mutual fund or ETF that automatically tracks a specific market index instead of trying to pick winning investments. A market index is a list that represents a slice of the market. For example:

- The **S&P 500** index tracks the 500 largest U.S. companies
- The **Total Stock Market** index tracks essentially every publicly traded U.S. company
- The **Total International** index tracks companies outside the United States

When you buy an S&P 500 index fund, you own a tiny piece of all 500 of the biggest companies in America -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and 496 others -- in a single purchase.

Why are index funds the recommended approach for beginners (and honestly, for most people)? Three big reasons:

1. **Low cost**: Index funds have very low expense ratios because no one is actively managing them
2. **Broad diversification**: You own hundreds or thousands of companies in one purchase
3. **Strong performance**: Over any 15-year period, index funds beat roughly 90% of professionally managed funds

Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has said repeatedly that most people should just buy a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. He even bet $1 million that an S&P 500 index fund would beat a collection of hedge funds over 10 years -- and he won.

### Investment Types Comparison

| Feature | Stocks | Bonds | Mutual Funds | ETFs | Index Funds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Ownership in one company | Loan to a government or company | Professionally managed pool | Pool that trades like a stock | Fund that tracks a market index |
| **Risk Level** | High | Low to Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Typical Long-Term Return** | 8-12% (varies wildly) | 3-5% | 6-9% | 6-10% | 8-10% |
| **Minimum Investment** | Price of one share ($1-$500+) | $1,000+ (or via fund) | $1-$3,000 | Price of one share ($1-$500) | $1 (many brokerages) |
| **Typical Expense Ratio** | N/A (per-trade fees) | N/A (per-trade fees) | 0.50%-1.50% | 0.03%-0.50% | 0.03%-0.20% |
| **Best For** | Experienced investors | Stability, near-retirement | Hands-off investors | Beginners, cost-conscious | **Almost everyone** |

## The Expense Ratio: A Small Number with Huge Impact

The **expense ratio** is the annual fee a fund charges you, expressed as a percentage of your investment. It covers the fund's operating costs. An expense ratio of 0.03% means you pay $3 per year for every $10,000 invested. An expense ratio of 1.50% means you pay $150 per year for every $10,000 invested.

That might not sound like a big deal, but over decades, those small percentages add up to staggering amounts.

| Expense Ratio | Annual Fee on $10,000 | Value After 30 Years (at 10% gross return) | Fees Paid Over 30 Years |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.03%** (index fund) | $3 | **$172,933** | **$1,561** |
| **0.50%** (average ETF) | $50 | **$149,744** | **$24,750** |
| **1.50%** (actively managed fund) | $150 | **$113,024** | **$61,470** |

Look at the difference between 0.03% and 1.50%. Over 30 years, the high-fee fund costs you almost **$60,000 more** in fees -- and you end up with about **$60,000 less** in your account. That is nearly $60,000 that went to the fund company instead of to your retirement.

This is why we recommend low-cost index funds. The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI) charges 0.03%. The Fidelity ZERO Total Market Index Fund (FZROX) charges literally 0.00%. These are the kinds of funds that put your money to work for you, not for a fund manager.

!!! warning "The 1% That Costs You a Fortune"
    A financial advisor who charges 1% of your portfolio per year might sound cheap. But on a $500,000 portfolio, that is $5,000 every single year. Over 30 years, that 1% fee can reduce your final portfolio value by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Always know what you are paying.

## Diversification: Do Not Put All Your Eggs in One Basket

**Diversification** means spreading your money across many different investments so that no single bad outcome can wreck your finances. If you own stock in just one company and that company goes bankrupt, you lose everything. If you own stock in 500 companies and one goes bankrupt, you barely notice.

This is the biggest advantage of index funds. When you buy a total stock market index fund, you own a piece of thousands of companies. Some will do great. Some will do poorly. Some will go bankrupt. But the overall market has historically trended upward over time.

True diversification means spreading across different types of investments, not just different companies:

- **Across companies**: Owning hundreds or thousands of stocks instead of a few
- **Across industries**: Technology, healthcare, finance, energy, consumer goods
- **Across geographies**: U.S. stocks AND international stocks
- **Across asset types**: Stocks AND bonds

A simple, well-diversified portfolio for a young investor might be just two or three funds:

1. A U.S. total stock market index fund (like VTI or FZROX)
2. An international stock index fund (like VXUS or FZILX)
3. A bond index fund (like BND or FXNAX) -- a small allocation for stability

That is it. Three funds and you own a piece of virtually every publicly traded company on Earth, plus a cushion of bonds. This is more diversified than most professional portfolios.

## Asset Allocation: Your Investment Recipe

**Asset allocation** is how you divide your money between different types of investments -- primarily stocks and bonds. Think of it like a recipe. Stocks are the spice (higher returns but more volatility). Bonds are the base (lower returns but more stability). Your allocation depends on your age, goals, and risk tolerance.

The classic rule of thumb is: subtract your age from 110 to get the percentage you should hold in stocks. So if you are 25 years old:

\[
110 - 25 = 85\% \text{ stocks, } 15\% \text{ bonds}
\]

If you are 35 years old:

\[
110 - 35 = 75\% \text{ stocks, } 25\% \text{ bonds}
\]

| Age | Stocks | Bonds | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20-25 | 85-90% | 10-15% | Decades to recover from downturns, maximize growth |
| 26-35 | 75-85% | 15-25% | Still aggressive, starting to add stability |
| 36-45 | 65-75% | 25-35% | Balancing growth with increasing stability |
| 46-55 | 55-65% | 35-45% | Shifting toward preservation as retirement nears |
| 56-65 | 40-55% | 45-60% | Protecting what you have built |

If you are in your twenties, you should be heavily in stocks (specifically stock index funds). You have 30-40 years before retirement. Short-term drops do not matter because you will not need this money for decades. What matters is long-term growth.

!!! tip "Target-Date Funds: The Easiest Option"
    If choosing your own allocation feels overwhelming, look for a **target-date fund**. You pick the fund with the year closest to when you plan to retire (for example, a "2060 Fund" if you plan to retire around 2060). The fund automatically adjusts your allocation from aggressive (more stocks) to conservative (more bonds) as you get closer to retirement. Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab all offer these with low expense ratios.

## The Power of Compound Growth

You learned about compound interest in Chapter 6 in the context of debt working against you. Now let us see it working for you.

When your investments earn returns, those returns get reinvested and start earning their own returns. It is growth on top of growth, and over time it creates a snowball effect.

Here is what $200 per month looks like invested at different average annual returns over different time periods:

| Time Period | At 6% Average Return | At 8% Average Return | At 10% Average Return |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 years | $32,776 | $36,589 | $40,969 |
| 20 years | $92,408 | $117,804 | $151,874 |
| 30 years | $200,903 | $298,072 | $452,098 |
| 40 years | $398,636 | $698,202 | $1,264,816 |

At 10% average return, $200 per month turns into **over $1.2 million** in 40 years. Your total contributions over those 40 years would be $96,000. The other $1.17 million is compound growth. Your money literally made more money than you did.

Try this: compare investing $200/month starting at age 22 versus starting at age 32. Notice how the 10-year head start creates a massive difference by age 62. Time is the secret ingredient.

## Opening Your First Brokerage Account

A **brokerage account** is an account at a financial company that lets you buy and sell investments like stocks, bonds, ETFs, and index funds. Think of it like a bank account, but instead of just holding cash, it holds your investments.

You do not need a lot of money to start. Most major brokerages now have no account minimums and no trading commissions. You can literally open an account and start investing with $50 or less.

### Step-by-Step: Open a Brokerage Account This Week

**Step 1: Choose a brokerage.** For beginners, we recommend one of these three. All offer no-minimum accounts, no trading commissions, and excellent low-cost index funds:

- **Fidelity** -- Offers zero-expense-ratio index funds (FZROX, FZILX). Great for absolute beginners.
- **Vanguard** -- The original home of index investing. Founded by Jack Bogle, the inventor of the index fund.
- **Charles Schwab** -- Excellent customer service, broad fund selection, and a user-friendly app.

**Step 2: Decide between a taxable brokerage account and a Roth IRA.** If you have not maxed out your Roth IRA yet ($7,000/year in 2025), open a Roth IRA first. You will learn more about Roth IRAs in Chapter 10, but the short version is: your money grows tax-free and you never pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If you have already maxed your Roth IRA, open a regular taxable brokerage account.

**Step 3: Gather your information.** You will need:

- Social Security number
- Government-issued ID (driver's license or passport)
- Bank account and routing number (for funding your account)
- Employment information
- About 10-15 minutes

**Step 4: Open the account online.** Go to the brokerage's website or download their app. Click "Open an Account" and follow the prompts. The process is similar to opening a bank account online.

**Step 5: Fund your account.** Link your bank account and transfer money in. Start with whatever you can afford -- even $50 is a real start. Set up automatic monthly transfers so investing becomes a habit, just like your emergency fund savings.

**Step 6: Buy your first index fund.** Once the money is in your account, search for one of these popular index funds and place a buy order:

- **VTI** (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) -- expense ratio 0.03%
- **FZROX** (Fidelity ZERO Total Market Index) -- expense ratio 0.00%
- **SWTSX** (Schwab Total Stock Market Index) -- expense ratio 0.03%

That is it. You are now an investor. You own a tiny piece of thousands of American companies, and your money is working for you around the clock.

!!! note "Fractional Shares Make Starting Easy"
    Worried that you cannot afford a full share of an ETF? Most brokerages now offer **fractional shares**, meaning you can buy a piece of a share. If VTI costs $280 per share but you only have $50, you can buy $50 worth (about 0.18 shares). Your $50 still grows at the same rate as a full share.

## Building Your First Portfolio

Your **portfolio** is the total collection of all your investments. As a beginner, keep it dead simple. You do not need 15 different funds. You need two or three.

**The Simple Starter Portfolio for a 20-Something:**

| Fund Type | Allocation | Example Fund | Expense Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. Total Stock Market Index | 70% | VTI or FZROX | 0.03% or 0.00% |
| International Stock Index | 20% | VXUS or FZILX | 0.07% or 0.00% |
| U.S. Bond Index | 10% | BND or FXNAX | 0.03% or 0.03% |

If you invest $200 per month with this allocation, here is what that looks like:

- $140/month into U.S. stock index fund
- $40/month into international stock index fund
- $20/month into bond index fund

Once a year, check your portfolio and **rebalance** -- sell a little of whatever grew the most and buy a little of whatever fell behind to get back to your target percentages. Most brokerages make this easy.

**Even simpler option:** Buy a single target-date fund and call it done. The fund handles diversification and rebalancing for you automatically.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Here is the order to follow with your money. Notice where investing fits:

1. **Build $1,000 starter emergency fund** -- Priority #1. Done before everything else.
2. **Get full employer 401(k) match** -- Free money from your employer. Covered in Chapter 11.
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** -- Credit cards, payday loans. Covered in Chapter 6.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months** -- Grow your safety net to full size. Covered in Chapter 5.
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** -- Tax-free growth. Covered in Chapter 10. **YOU ARE HERE.**
6. **Invest in low-cost index funds** -- In a taxable brokerage account after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** -- Car loans, some student loans.
8. **Save for specific goals** -- House down payment, wedding, travel.

The key takeaway: do not skip straight to investing. Make sure your foundation (emergency fund, employer match, high-interest debt) is solid first. But once it is, invest as aggressively as you can. Every year you wait costs you.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Waiting until you "know enough" to start.** You do not need to become a financial expert before investing. Buy a total stock market index fund and you are doing better than most people. You can learn more as you go.

**Mistake #2: Trying to pick individual stocks.** Unless you are willing to spend hours researching companies and accept the risk of significant losses, stick with index funds. Even professional fund managers fail to beat index funds most of the time.

**Mistake #3: Checking your investments every day.** The stock market goes up and down daily. If you check every day, you will panic during drops and make emotional decisions. Check once a month at most. Once a quarter is even better.

**Mistake #4: Selling when the market drops.** This is the single most expensive mistake investors make. When the market crashes, beginners panic and sell at the bottom. Then the market recovers and they miss the rebound. The strategy is simple: invest consistently and do not sell during downturns. Stay the course.

**Mistake #5: Paying high fees.** Every dollar in fees is a dollar that is not growing for you. Stick to index funds with expense ratios below 0.20%. Ideally below 0.10%. Never pay a front-end load (a sales fee just to buy into a fund).

**Mistake #6: Not investing because you think you need a lot of money.** You can start with $50. You can start with $10. Fractional shares mean there is truly no minimum. The amount matters far less than the habit of investing consistently.

**Mistake #7: Investing money you will need within 5 years.** The stock market can drop 30% in a year. If you need the money for a down payment in 2 years, keep it in a high-yield savings account. Only invest money you will not touch for at least 5 years, ideally 10 or more.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of investing fundamentals.

??? question "1. $10,000 invested at 10% average annual return for 30 years grows to approximately how much?"
    **About $174,494.** Calculated as \( \$10{,}000 \times (1.10)^{30} = \$174{,}494 \). Compare this to the same $10,000 in a savings account at 4.5%, which would grow to only $37,453. The difference -- over $137,000 -- is the power of investing.

??? question "2. What is an index fund, and why is it recommended for beginners?"
    **An index fund is a type of mutual fund or ETF that automatically tracks a market index** (like the S&P 500). It is recommended because it offers instant diversification across hundreds or thousands of companies, charges very low fees (often 0.03% or less), and historically outperforms about 90% of professionally managed funds over the long term.

??? question "3. If you are 25 years old, what is the recommended stock-to-bond allocation using the '110 minus age' rule?"
    **85% stocks, 15% bonds.** Calculated as \( 110 - 25 = 85 \). At 25, you have decades for your investments to recover from any short-term drops, so a higher stock allocation maximizes your long-term growth potential.

??? question "4. What is an expense ratio, and why does it matter?"
    **The expense ratio is the annual fee a fund charges, expressed as a percentage of your investment.** It matters because even small differences compound dramatically over time. A 1.50% expense ratio on $10,000 over 30 years costs about $61,470 in fees, versus only $1,561 for a 0.03% index fund. That is nearly $60,000 lost to fees.

??? question "5. Why is diversification important?"
    **Diversification spreads your risk across many investments** so that no single company, industry, or asset class can devastate your portfolio. If one company goes bankrupt, a diversified index fund barely notices. This is why index funds (which hold hundreds or thousands of stocks) are safer than picking individual stocks.

??? question "6. You just got your first full-time job. You have no debt and a $1,000 emergency fund. What should you do about investing?"
    **First, get your full employer 401(k) match (Priority #2), then build your emergency fund to 3-6 months (Priority #4), then max out a Roth IRA ($7,000/year, Priority #5), and then invest additional money in low-cost index funds in a taxable brokerage account (Priority #6).** Follow the priority framework in order.

## Key Terms

- **Investing**: Putting money into assets (stocks, bonds, funds) that you expect to grow in value over time, generating returns that outpace inflation and build wealth.

- **Risk vs. Return**: The fundamental investing principle that higher potential returns come with higher risk of loss. Savings accounts are low risk and low return; stocks are higher risk and higher return.

- **Time Value of Money**: The concept that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future because it can be invested to earn returns. This is why starting to invest early is so powerful.

- **Inflation**: The gradual increase in prices over time, which reduces the purchasing power of your money. The U.S. averages about 3% inflation per year over the long term.

- **Purchasing Power**: What your money can actually buy. As inflation rises, the purchasing power of each dollar decreases, which is why investing (to outpace inflation) is essential.

- **Stock**: A share of ownership in a company. Stocks offer the highest historical returns among major asset classes but also the highest short-term volatility.

- **Bond**: A loan you make to a government or corporation in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of your principal at maturity. Bonds are generally lower risk and lower return than stocks.

- **Mutual Fund**: A professionally managed pool of money from many investors, used to buy a diversified collection of stocks, bonds, or other assets. Mutual funds often carry higher expense ratios than ETFs.

- **Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)**: A collection of investments bundled into a single fund that trades on the stock exchange like an individual stock. ETFs typically have lower fees than mutual funds and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day.

- **Index Fund**: A type of mutual fund or ETF that automatically tracks a market index (like the S&P 500) instead of trying to beat the market. Index funds offer low costs, broad diversification, and historically strong performance.

- **Expense Ratio**: The annual fee charged by a fund, expressed as a percentage of your total investment. Low-cost index funds charge as little as 0.00%-0.03%, while actively managed funds may charge 1.00%-1.50% or more.

- **Diversification**: Spreading your investments across many different companies, industries, geographies, and asset types to reduce the risk that any single bad outcome significantly harms your portfolio.

- **Asset Allocation**: The strategy of dividing your portfolio between different asset classes (primarily stocks and bonds) based on your age, goals, and risk tolerance.

- **Portfolio**: The complete collection of all your investments. A well-built portfolio is diversified across asset types and aligned with your financial goals and time horizon.

- **Brokerage Account**: An account at a financial institution (like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab) that allows you to buy and sell investments such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.

## What To Do This Week

Here is your action plan. Do these in order.

- [ ] **Day 1**: Check where you are in the priority framework. Do you have your $1,000 emergency fund? Are you getting your full employer 401(k) match? Is your high-interest debt paid off? Make sure your foundation is solid before investing.
- [ ] **Day 2**: Choose a brokerage. If you do not already have one, pick Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab. Read reviews if you want, but all three are excellent. Do not let the choice paralyze you.
- [ ] **Day 3**: Open your account. Gather your Social Security number, ID, and bank info, then open a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a regular brokerage account. This takes about 15 minutes online.
- [ ] **Day 4**: Fund your account. Transfer at least $50 from your bank account. Set up an automatic monthly transfer on your payday so investing becomes a habit.
- [ ] **Day 5**: Buy your first index fund. Search for VTI (Vanguard), FZROX (Fidelity), or SWTSX (Schwab) and place a buy order. Congratulations -- you are now an investor.
- [ ] **Weekend**: Set a calendar reminder to check your portfolio once per month. Not once per day, not once per week. Once per month. Write down your target asset allocation (for example, 85% stocks / 15% bonds) so you have a plan to stick to when markets get choppy.

Starting to invest is one of the most impactful financial decisions you will ever make. You do not need to be an expert. You do not need a lot of money. You just need to start, stay consistent, and let compound growth do the heavy lifting over time.
