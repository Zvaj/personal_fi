4. Financial Goals
5. SMART Goals
6. Net Worth
7. Assets
8. Liabilities

## Why This Chapter Matters

Here is the truth nobody tells you in school: how you *think* about money matters more than how much you earn. People earning $200,000 a year go broke. People earning $45,000 a year retire as millionaires. The difference is almost never math. It is mindset.

This chapter is not about budgeting spreadsheets or stock picks. It is about the invisible beliefs running your financial life right now, whether you realize it or not. Once you see them clearly, you can start making choices instead of just reacting.

We will cover three big ideas:

- **Your money story** -- the beliefs you absorbed growing up that silently drive every financial decision you make
- **Goal setting that actually works** -- turning vague wishes like "I want to be rich" into concrete plans
- **Your financial starting point** -- calculating your net worth so you know exactly where you stand today

## What Is Personal Finance, Really?

**Personal finance** is the practice of managing your own money -- earning it, spending it, saving it, investing it, and protecting it. That is the textbook definition. Here is the real one:

Personal finance is the skill of making your money work for *your* life, not someone else's.

It covers everything from your paycheck to your retirement account, from your student loans to your grocery budget. And here is what makes it "personal" -- the right answers depend on *your* situation, *your* values, and *your* goals.

| Common Myth | Reality |
|---|---|
| You need to earn a lot to build wealth | You need to *keep* and *grow* what you earn |
| Rich people are just lucky | Most wealth is built through consistent habits over time |
| You need a finance degree to manage money | You need basic math and the willingness to learn |
| "I'll figure it out later" is fine | Every year you wait costs you real money (we will prove this later) |

Personal finance is not about being cheap. It is not about never enjoying life. It is about being intentional so your money goes where *you* want it to go.

## Money Mindset: The Operating System You Did Not Choose

Your **money mindset** is your collection of attitudes, beliefs, and feelings about money. Think of it as the operating system running in the background of every financial decision you make. You did not install it on purpose -- it was installed for you during childhood.

Maybe you grew up hearing "money doesn't grow on trees" every time you asked for something. Maybe your family never discussed money at all, and it became this mysterious, slightly scary topic. Maybe you saw a parent stress about bills every month, or maybe money seemed to flow easily and you never worried about it.

All of those experiences shaped your money mindset. And that mindset is making decisions for you right now.

### Signs Your Money Mindset Might Be Working Against You

- You feel guilty every time you spend money on yourself
- You avoid looking at your bank account because it stresses you out
- You spend impulsively when you are stressed, bored, or sad
- You believe "people like me" never get ahead financially
- You think talking about money is rude or taboo

None of these are character flaws. They are learned patterns. And anything learned can be unlearned.

## Money Scripts: The Hidden Rules Running Your Finances

Psychologists Brad and Ted Klontz identified four categories of **money scripts** -- the unconscious beliefs about money you absorbed from your family, culture, and experiences before you were old enough to question them. These scripts run on autopilot unless you deliberately examine them.

| Money Script | Core Belief | Typical Behavior | Example Thought |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Money Avoidance** | Money is bad or I do not deserve it | Ignoring bills, giving money away, sabotaging success | "Rich people are greedy" |
| **Money Worship** | More money will solve everything | Overspending, workaholism, never feeling "enough" | "If I just earned more, I'd be happy" |
| **Money Status** | Self-worth equals net worth | Buying things to impress, living beyond means | "People will respect me if I drive a nice car" |
| **Money Vigilance** | Be alert and frugal always | Over-saving, anxiety about spending, secrecy about finances | "You never know when disaster will strike" |

Here is the key insight: **none of these scripts is entirely wrong or entirely right.** Money vigilance can make you a great saver, but it can also make you miserable and unable to enjoy what you have earned. Money worship can drive ambition, but it can leave you on a treadmill that never stops.

### How to Identify Your Money Scripts

Try this exercise right now. Finish these sentences with the first thing that comes to mind -- do not overthink it:

1. People who have a lot of money are ___________
2. Money is ___________
3. I deserve ___________
4. If I had more money, I would ___________
5. My parents taught me that money is ___________

Your answers reveal your dominant money scripts. Write them down. We will revisit them at the end of the chapter.

## Income and Expenses: The Two Levers

Before we talk about goals, let us make sure two foundational terms are crystal clear.

**Income** is money coming in. This includes your paycheck, freelance earnings, side hustle revenue, birthday money from grandma, interest from a savings account -- any money flowing toward you. Your income is the raw material you have to work with.

**Expenses** are money going out. Rent, groceries, Netflix, gas, student loan payments, that coffee you grabbed this morning -- any money flowing away from you.

The gap between income and expenses is everything. That gap is what you save, invest, and use to build wealth. There are only two ways to widen it:

1. **Earn more** (increase income)
2. **Spend less** (decrease expenses)

Most people focus exclusively on cutting expenses, which has a floor -- you cannot cut below zero. Increasing income has no ceiling. The best strategy works both sides.

### A Real Example

Meet Alex, age 24, working a full-time job:

| Category | Monthly Amount |
|---|---|
| **Income** | |
| Take-home pay (after taxes) | $3,200 |
| Occasional freelance work | $300 |
| **Total Income** | **$3,500** |
| **Expenses** | |
| Rent + utilities | $1,200 |
| Groceries | $350 |
| Car payment + insurance | $450 |
| Student loan payment | $280 |
| Phone + subscriptions | $120 |
| Gas + transportation | $150 |
| Eating out + entertainment | $300 |
| Miscellaneous | $150 |
| **Total Expenses** | **$3,000** |
| **Gap (Income - Expenses)** | **$500** |

Alex has a $500 monthly gap. That $500 is the seed of Alex's entire financial future. Where it goes matters enormously -- which brings us to goals.

## Financial Goals: From "I Wish" to "I Will"

A **financial goal** is a specific money target you are working toward. "I want to be good with money" is a wish. "I want to save $1,000 for an emergency fund by June 30th" is a financial goal.

Most people fail at money not because they lack discipline, but because they lack direction. Vague intentions produce vague results. Clear goals produce clear actions.

### SMART Goals: The Framework That Works

**SMART goals** are goals that meet five specific criteria. This framework turns fuzzy wishes into trackable plans.

| Letter | Stands For | Bad Example | Good Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S** | Specific | "Save more money" | "Save $1,000 for an emergency fund" |
| **M** | Measurable | "Get better with money" | "Reduce eating-out spending to $150/month" |
| **A** | Achievable | "Save $50,000 this year on a $40K salary" | "Save $3,000 this year by setting aside $250/month" |
| **R** | Relevant | "Buy a boat" (when you need an emergency fund) | "Build a $1,000 emergency fund first" |
| **T** | Time-bound | "Start investing someday" | "Open a Roth IRA by March 15th" |

### Setting Your First Three Financial Goals

You do not need twenty goals. You need three:

1. **A 30-day goal** -- something you can accomplish this month (example: "Track every dollar I spend for 30 days")
2. **A 6-month goal** -- your first real milestone (example: "Save $1,000 for my starter emergency fund by August")
3. **A 5-year goal** -- your North Star (example: "Have $20,000 in investments by age 28")

Write them down. Seriously. People who write down their goals are 42% more likely to achieve them, according to research by psychologist Gail Matthews at Dominican University.

## Net Worth: Your Financial Scoreboard

**Net worth** is the single most important number in your personal finances. It answers one question: "If I sold everything I own and paid off everything I owe, what would be left?"

The formula is simple:

\[
\text{Net Worth} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
\]

**Assets** are things you own that have monetary value. Your car, your savings account, your investments, cash in your wallet -- anything you could sell or withdraw.

**Liabilities** are debts you owe. Student loans, credit card balances, car loans, money you borrowed from a friend -- anything you are obligated to pay back.

### Calculating Your Net Worth: Step by Step

**Step 1: List your assets and their approximate values.**

| Asset | Example Value |
|---|---|
| Checking account balance | $1,500 |
| Savings account balance | $800 |
| Cash on hand | $50 |
| Car (current resale value, not what you paid) | $8,000 |
| Investments (401k, IRA, brokerage) | $2,200 |
| Other (electronics, valuables you could sell) | $500 |
| **Total Assets** | **$13,050** |

**Step 2: List your liabilities.**

| Liability | Example Value |
|---|---|
| Student loans | $22,000 |
| Credit card balance | $1,800 |
| Car loan remaining | $6,500 |
| Money owed to family/friends | $500 |
| **Total Liabilities** | **$30,800** |

**Step 3: Subtract.**

\[
\$13{,}050 - \$30{,}800 = -\$17{,}750
\]

**A negative net worth is completely normal for young adults.** If you have student loans, your net worth is almost certainly negative right now. That is not failure -- it is your starting line. The only thing that matters is the direction it moves from here.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Now that you know about income, expenses, and net worth, the obvious question is: *"Okay, but what do I actually DO with my money?"*

Here is the priority list. Work through it in order. Do not skip to step 6 because investing sounds exciting while step 1 sounds boring. The order matters.

| Priority | Action | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Build a $1,000 starter emergency fund** | Stops you from going into debt for unexpected expenses |
| 2 | **Get your full employer 401(k) match** | This is literally free money -- a 50-100% instant return |
| 3 | **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** | Credit card debt at 20%+ APR destroys wealth faster than anything |
| 4 | **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses** | Full protection against job loss, medical emergencies, car breakdowns |
| 5 | **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** | Tax-free growth for decades; the earlier you start, the more powerful it is |
| 6 | **Invest additional money in low-cost index funds** | Build long-term wealth with minimal effort and fees |
| 7 | **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** | Student loans and similar debt -- not urgent but worth eliminating |
| 8 | **Save for specific goals (house, car, travel)** | Once the foundation is solid, fund your dreams |

**Most people reading this should start at Priority 1.** If you do not have $1,000 set aside for emergencies, that is your only job right now. Not investing, not paying extra on student loans. Get that $1,000 first.

### Why This Order?

The order is based on a simple idea: **plug the holes before you fill the bucket.** High-interest debt and lack of emergency savings are holes. Every dollar you invest while carrying 22% credit card debt is a dollar working against you.

Think of it as building a house. You would not install the kitchen cabinets before pouring the foundation. Same principle here.

## Financial Habits: Small Actions, Massive Results

Your **financial habits** -- the small, repeated money behaviors you do without thinking -- determine your financial future far more than any single big decision. A daily $6 coffee habit costs $2,190 a year. We are not saying never buy coffee. We are saying *know what your habits cost* and *decide if they are worth it.*

### The Three Keystone Financial Habits

These three habits form the foundation everything else is built on:

1. **Track your spending.** You cannot manage what you do not measure. Use an app, a spreadsheet, or a notebook -- the method does not matter. Do it every day for 30 days. You will be surprised.

2. **Pay yourself first.** When you get paid, immediately move money to savings or investments *before* you spend on anything else. If you wait until the end of the month to save "whatever's left," there will never be anything left.

3. **Review weekly.** Spend 15 minutes every Sunday looking at your accounts. What came in? What went out? Are you on track for your goals? This is not optional. This is how you stay in control.

### The Compound Effect of Habits

Small amounts, invested consistently, become life-changing sums. Here is what happens when you invest $200 per month starting at different ages, assuming a 7% average annual return:

| Starting Age | Monthly Investment | Total Invested by 65 | Value at 65 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | $200 | $103,200 | ~$620,000 |
| 27 | $200 | $91,200 | ~$430,000 |
| 32 | $200 | $79,200 | ~$295,000 |
| 37 | $200 | $67,200 | ~$199,000 |

The person who started at 22 invested only $12,000 more than the person who started at 27, but ended up with roughly **$190,000 more.** That is the power of time plus consistency. Every year you wait costs you real money.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learning from other people's mistakes is cheaper than making your own. Here are the most common traps young adults fall into:

**Mistake 1: Waiting until you "make more money" to start.**
There is no perfect income level to begin. Start with $25 a month if that is what you have. The habit matters more than the amount.

**Mistake 2: Trying to do everything at once.**
Follow the priority framework. One step at a time. Trying to save for a house, invest in crypto, pay off debt, *and* build an emergency fund simultaneously means you make meaningful progress on none of them.

**Mistake 3: Comparing your Chapter 1 to someone else's Chapter 20.**
Your coworker with the new car might be $40,000 in debt. Your friend posting vacation photos might be living paycheck to paycheck. You do not know anyone else's real financial situation. Run your own race.

**Mistake 4: Treating a budget as punishment.**
A budget is not a diet for your wallet. It is a plan that tells your money where to go so you do not wonder where it went. A good budget includes fun money -- guilt-free spending on things you enjoy.

**Mistake 5: Ignoring your money scripts.**
If you skip the mindset work in this chapter and jump straight to spreadsheets, your unconscious beliefs will sabotage you. Identify your scripts. Challenge the ones that are not serving you.

## Quick Quiz

??? question "Question 1: What is net worth?"

    **A.** How much money you earn per year

    **B.** The total value of everything you own

    **C.** Assets minus liabilities

    **D.** Your credit score

    ??? success "Answer"

        **C. Assets minus liabilities.** Net worth is what you would have left if you sold everything you own and paid off everything you owe. It is the single best snapshot of your overall financial health.

??? question "Question 2: Which money script might cause someone to overspend on luxury items to impress others?"

    **A.** Money Avoidance

    **B.** Money Worship

    **C.** Money Status

    **D.** Money Vigilance

    ??? success "Answer"

        **C. Money Status.** People with a Money Status script tie their self-worth to their net worth (or the appearance of it), often spending beyond their means to project an image of success.

??? question "Question 3: According to the priority framework, what should most young adults do FIRST with extra money?"

    **A.** Max out their Roth IRA

    **B.** Pay off student loans

    **C.** Build a $1,000 starter emergency fund

    **D.** Invest in index funds

    ??? success "Answer"

        **C. Build a $1,000 starter emergency fund.** This is Priority 1 because it prevents you from going into debt when unexpected expenses hit. Without this safety net, one car repair or medical bill can spiral into high-interest credit card debt.

??? question "Question 4: What does the 'A' in SMART goals stand for?"

    **A.** Actionable

    **B.** Achievable

    **C.** Ambitious

    **D.** Automatic

    ??? success "Answer"

        **B. Achievable.** A goal needs to be realistic given your current situation. "Save $50,000 this year on a $40,000 salary" is not achievable. "Save $3,000 by setting aside $250/month" is.

??? question "Question 5: Why is a negative net worth normal for young adults?"

    **A.** Because young people are bad with money

    **B.** Because student loans and car loans often exceed assets early in life

    **C.** Because net worth does not matter until you are older

    **D.** Because banks set your net worth for you

    ??? success "Answer"

        **B. Because student loans and car loans often exceed assets early in life.** A negative net worth in your early twenties is a starting point, not a failure. What matters is the direction your net worth moves over time.

## What To Do This Week

These are not suggestions. These are assignments. Do them this week, not "someday."

- [ ] **Monday: Complete the Money Scripts exercise.** Finish the five sentences in the Money Scripts section. Write your answers on paper or in your phone's notes app. Identify which of the four money script categories fits you best.

- [ ] **Tuesday: Calculate your net worth.** Use the Net Worth Calculator MicroSim above or a simple spreadsheet. List every asset and every liability. Write down the number. This is your starting line.

- [ ] **Wednesday: Write three SMART financial goals.** One 30-day goal, one 6-month goal, one 5-year goal. Make sure each one passes the SMART test. Put them somewhere you will see them daily.

- [ ] **Thursday: Open a separate savings account for your emergency fund.** Many online banks (like Ally, Marcus, or Discover) offer high-yield savings accounts with no minimum balance. This takes about 10 minutes. Label it "Emergency Fund" and set up an automatic transfer of whatever you can afford -- even $25 per paycheck.

- [ ] **Weekend: Start tracking your spending.** Download a free app (Mint, YNAB trial, or a simple spreadsheet) and log every dollar you spend from now through the end of the month. Every coffee, every subscription, every impulse buy. No judgment -- just data.
