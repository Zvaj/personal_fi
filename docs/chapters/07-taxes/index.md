## Introduction: Taxes Are Not the Enemy

Here is an uncomfortable truth: most young adults have no idea how taxes actually work. They see money disappear from their paycheck and accept it as a fact of life. Some people even turn down raises because they think "moving into a higher tax bracket" will make them take home less money. That belief is completely wrong, and this chapter will show you exactly why.

**Taxes** are mandatory payments to the government — federal, state, and local — that fund public services like roads, schools, the military, and Social Security. You cannot avoid them (legally), but you absolutely can understand them well enough to keep more of your money.

The key insight of this chapter is simple: the tax code rewards certain behaviors. Contributing to retirement accounts, owning a home, going to school, and having children all reduce your tax bill. When you understand these rules, you stop overpaying. You are not "cheating" — you are using the system exactly as it was designed.

By the end of this chapter, you will know how to read your paycheck, calculate your actual tax rate, file your taxes confidently, and make smart decisions that legally reduce what you owe.

!!! tip "Where This Fits in the Priority Framework"
    Taxes touch almost every priority. Your 401(k) contributions (Priority 2) reduce your taxable income. Your Roth IRA (Priority 5) grows tax-free. Even your emergency fund earns interest that gets taxed. Understanding taxes is not a separate goal — it is the operating system running underneath all your other financial decisions.

## How Taxes Work: The Big Picture

Before diving into details, let's understand the three main types of taxes that come out of your paycheck.

### Federal Income Tax

**Federal income tax** is the tax you pay to the U.S. government based on how much you earn. This is the big one — it typically takes the largest bite. The amount you owe depends on your income level and is calculated using **tax brackets** (we will break these down in detail shortly).

Federal income tax is progressive, meaning people who earn more pay a higher percentage on their additional income. This is a feature, not a bug — and understanding how it actually works is the single most important tax concept in this chapter.

### State Income Tax

**State income tax** is a separate tax charged by your state government. Most states charge between 1% and 13% of your income, though the specifics vary widely.

- **No state income tax:** Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire (dividends and interest only), South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming
- **Flat rate states:** States like Illinois (4.95%) and Colorado (4.4%) charge everyone the same percentage
- **Progressive states:** States like California (1% to 13.3%) and New York (4% to 10.9%) use brackets similar to the federal system

Where you live matters. Someone earning $60,000 in Texas keeps more take-home pay than someone earning $60,000 in California, all else being equal. That said, state income tax is just one factor in cost of living — do not move to Texas solely for the tax savings if your rent doubles.

### FICA Taxes

**FICA taxes** stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. This is the money that funds Social Security and Medicare. Unlike income tax, FICA is a flat percentage with no brackets.

- **Social Security:** 6.2% of your income, up to $176,100 in 2025 (your employer pays another 6.2%)
- **Medicare:** 1.45% of all income, no cap (your employer pays another 1.45%)
- **Total FICA from your paycheck:** 7.65%

FICA taxes are non-negotiable. There are no deductions or credits that reduce them (for employees). Every dollar you earn up to the Social Security cap gets hit with 7.65%. This is why your paycheck looks smaller than you expected — income tax and FICA together can take 25-35% of your gross pay.

---

## Tax Brackets: The Most Misunderstood Concept in Finance

**Tax brackets** are the income ranges that determine what percentage of federal income tax you pay. The United States uses a system of graduated brackets — the more you earn, the higher the rate on your additional income.

Here are the 2025 federal tax brackets for a single filer:

| Tax Rate | Income Range | Tax Owed on This Range |
|---|---|---|
| 10% | $0 - $11,925 | Up to $1,192.50 |
| 12% | $11,926 - $48,475 | Up to $4,386.00 |
| 22% | $48,476 - $103,350 | Up to $12,072.50 |
| 24% | $103,351 - $197,300 | Up to $22,548.00 |
| 32% | $197,301 - $250,525 | Up to $17,031.68 |
| 35% | $250,526 - $626,350 | Up to $131,538.75 |
| 37% | Over $626,350 | 37% of amount over $626,350 |

Now here is the part that trips everyone up.

## Marginal vs. Effective Tax Rate: Why You Should Never Fear a Raise

Your **marginal tax rate** is the tax rate on your *last* dollar of income — the highest bracket your income reaches. Your **effective tax rate** is the actual overall percentage of your income that goes to federal taxes. These two numbers are very different, and confusing them is the most expensive tax mistake young adults make.

**The critical concept:** Tax brackets are *marginal*, not flat. When you "move into the 22% bracket," only the income *above* the 22% threshold is taxed at 22%. All your income below that threshold is still taxed at the lower rates. You never lose money by earning more.

Let's prove this with a real calculation.

#### Diagram: How Marginal Tax Rates Work

<details>
<summary>Income Divided Into Bracket Layers (Single Filer Earning $55,000)</summary>

```
Your $55,000 income, taxed layer by layer:

$55,000 ┌─────────────────────────┐
        │  $6,525 taxed at 22%   │ ← Only this portion at 22%
$48,475 ├─────────────────────────┤
        │                         │
        │  $36,550 taxed at 12%  │ ← This chunk at 12%
        │                         │
$11,925 ├─────────────────────────┤
        │  $11,925 taxed at 10%  │ ← First dollars at 10%
     $0 └─────────────────────────┘

Marginal rate: 22%  (rate on your LAST dollar)
Effective rate: 12.2% (what you ACTUALLY pay overall)
```

Your income fills up each bracket like water filling stacked containers.
Only the water that spills over into the next container gets taxed at the higher rate.

## Step-by-Step: Calculating Tax on $55,000 Income

Let's walk through exactly how much federal income tax someone earning $55,000 as a single filer would owe in 2025. This is the real math, no shortcuts.

### Step 1: Start With Gross Income

**Gross income** is your total earnings before anything is subtracted. In this example, that is $55,000.

### Step 2: Subtract the Standard Deduction

The **standard deduction** is an amount the government lets you subtract from your income before calculating taxes. For 2025, the standard deduction for a single filer is **$15,000**. (We will cover when to itemize instead later in this chapter.)

\[
\$55{,}000 - \$15{,}000 = \$40{,}000 \text{ (taxable income)}
\]

This means you only pay federal income tax on $40,000 — not the full $55,000.

### Step 3: Apply Each Bracket

Now we push that $40,000 through the brackets, layer by layer.

**First bracket (10%): $0 to $11,925**

\[
\$11{,}925 \times 0.10 = \$1{,}192.50
\]

**Second bracket (12%): $11,926 to $40,000**

Your taxable income stops at $40,000, so only $28,075 falls in this bracket.

\[
\$28{,}075 \times 0.12 = \$3{,}369.00
\]

**Third bracket (22%):** Your taxable income does not reach $48,475, so nothing is taxed at 22%.

### Step 4: Add It Up

\[
\$1{,}192.50 + \$3{,}369.00 = \$4{,}561.50 \text{ (total federal income tax)}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Your Effective Rate

\[
\text{Effective Tax Rate} = \frac{\$4{,}561.50}{\$55{,}000} \times 100 = 8.3\%
\]

Even though the marginal rate for a $55,000 earner is 12% (the highest bracket reached after the standard deduction), the effective federal income tax rate is only **8.3%** of gross income. That is a long way from the 22% bracket people worry about "falling into."

!!! warning "The Raise Myth — Busted"
    Your coworker says, "I don't want a raise because it'll push me into a higher tax bracket and I'll make less money." This is **never true**. If you earn $1 more that pushes you from the 12% bracket into the 22% bracket, only that single dollar is taxed at 22%. The rest of your income stays at the same rates. A raise always increases your take-home pay. Always.

### The Full Picture: All Taxes Combined

Federal income tax is not the only tax. Let's see the complete picture for our $55,000 earner.

| Tax Type | Amount | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Federal Income Tax | $4,561.50 | 8.3% |
| Social Security (6.2%) | $3,410.00 | 6.2% |
| Medicare (1.45%) | $797.50 | 1.45% |
| **Total Federal Taxes** | **$8,769.00** | **15.9%** |
| State Income Tax (varies) | Depends on state | 0-13% |

If this person lives in a state with no income tax, they take home roughly $46,231 before state or local taxes. In a state like Illinois (4.95% flat), state tax adds another $2,722.50, bringing take-home pay down to around $43,509.

## Your W-2, W-4, and 1099: The Tax Forms That Matter

Three forms control your tax life as a young adult. Here is what each one does and why you should care.

### The W-4 Form: Telling Your Employer How Much to Withhold

Your **W-4 form** is the form you fill out when you start a new job. It tells your employer how much federal income tax to withhold (take out) from each paycheck. The more "allowances" or adjustments you claim, the less tax is withheld per paycheck — but you may owe money at tax time.

**What to actually do:** When you start a new job, fill out the W-4 accurately. If you have a simple situation (one job, no dependents), the default settings are usually correct. If you find yourself owing a large amount at tax time or getting a huge refund, adjust your W-4.

### The W-2 Form: Your Annual Earnings Report

Your **W-2 form** is the document your employer sends you by January 31 each year. It shows exactly how much you earned and how much tax was withheld during the previous year. You need this form to file your taxes.

Key boxes on your W-2:

- **Box 1:** Total wages and salary (your taxable income from this employer)
- **Box 2:** Federal income tax withheld
- **Box 3-6:** Social Security and Medicare wages and withholding
- **Box 12:** Retirement contributions (401(k), etc.)
- **Box 17:** State income tax withheld

### The 1099 Form: Independent Contractor Income

A **1099 form** (specifically 1099-NEC for non-employee compensation) is what you get instead of a W-2 when you work as an independent contractor or freelancer. The client pays you without withholding any taxes — which means you are responsible for paying all of them yourself.

### W-2 vs. 1099: Employee vs. Contractor

| Factor | W-2 Employee | 1099 Contractor |
|---|---|---|
| Taxes withheld from pay? | Yes — employer handles it | No — you must pay estimated taxes quarterly |
| FICA taxes | Split 50/50 with employer (you pay 7.65%) | You pay the full 15.3% (self-employment tax) |
| Benefits (health, retirement) | Often provided by employer | You arrange and pay for your own |
| Standard deduction | Yes | Yes |
| Business expense deductions | Very limited | Yes — supplies, mileage, home office, etc. |
| Tax filing complexity | Simple (one W-2, standard form) | More complex (Schedule C, estimated payments) |
| Job security | Employment protections apply | Can be terminated without notice |

!!! example "1099 Income in Practice"
    Jordan drives for a rideshare app and earns $20,000 in a year. No taxes are withheld from their payments. At tax time, Jordan owes:

    - **Federal income tax** on $20,000 (minus deductions)
    - **Self-employment tax:** \( \$20{,}000 \times 0.153 = \$3{,}060 \) (the full 15.3% FICA)
    - **State income tax** (if applicable)

    Jordan can deduct business expenses like mileage, phone costs, and car maintenance to lower their taxable income. But the self-employment tax alone is a surprise to many first-time 1099 workers. If Jordan does not save for taxes throughout the year, they will face a large bill in April.

**The bottom line:** If you are a 1099 contractor, set aside 25-30% of every payment for taxes. Open a separate savings account and transfer the money immediately. Do not spend it.

---

## Tax Deductions: Reducing Your Taxable Income

A **tax deduction** reduces the amount of income that gets taxed. It does not reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar — it reduces the income your tax bill is calculated on. The value of a deduction depends on your marginal tax rate.

If you are in the 12% bracket and you claim a $1,000 deduction, you save \( \$1{,}000 \times 0.12 = \$120 \) in taxes. If you are in the 22% bracket, that same $1,000 deduction saves you $220. Deductions are worth more to people in higher brackets.

### Standard Deduction vs. Itemized Deductions

You get to choose one or the other — not both.

The **standard deduction** is a flat amount you subtract from your income. For 2025:

- **Single filer:** $15,000
- **Married filing jointly:** $30,000
- **Head of household:** $22,500

**Itemized deductions** are specific expenses you list individually. Common itemized deductions include:

- **State and local taxes (SALT):** Up to $10,000
- **Mortgage interest:** On loans up to $750,000
- **Charitable donations:** Cash and property given to qualified nonprofits
- **Medical expenses:** Only the amount exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income

### When to Itemize vs. Take the Standard Deduction

Here is the simple rule: **add up your itemized deductions. If the total is more than the standard deduction, itemize. If not, take the standard deduction.**

For most young adults, the standard deduction wins easily. You would need more than $15,000 in deductible expenses to beat it, and that is hard to reach without a mortgage, large charitable gifts, or significant medical bills.

Roughly 87% of taxpayers use the standard deduction. If you rent your home, do not have a mortgage, and do not make large charitable contributions, the standard deduction is almost certainly the right choice.

---

## Tax Credits: The Dollar-for-Dollar Savings

A **tax credit** reduces your tax bill directly — dollar for dollar. Credits are far more valuable than deductions because they come straight off the amount you owe.

| Feature | Tax Deduction | Tax Credit |
|---|---|---|
| What it reduces | Your taxable income | Your tax bill directly |
| $1,000 example (12% bracket) | Saves you $120 | Saves you $1,000 |
| $1,000 example (22% bracket) | Saves you $220 | Saves you $1,000 |
| Who benefits more? | Higher-income filers | Everyone benefits equally |

### Credits Most Relevant to Young Adults

- **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC):** For lower-income workers. Worth up to $632 for a single filer with no children in 2025. The credit phases out as income rises.
- **American Opportunity Tax Credit:** Worth up to $2,500 per year for the first four years of college. 40% is refundable, meaning you can get up to $1,000 back even if you owe zero tax.
- **Lifetime Learning Credit:** Worth up to $2,000 per year for any post-secondary education or courses to improve job skills. Not limited to four years.
- **Saver's Credit:** Worth up to $1,000 ($2,000 if married) for contributing to a retirement account. Available to lower-income filers. This is a direct reward for saving — if you qualify, it is free money.

!!! tip "Credits vs. Deductions: The Quick Test"
    If someone offers you a $1,000 tax credit or a $1,000 tax deduction, always take the credit. The credit saves you $1,000 in taxes no matter what bracket you are in. The deduction saves you only $120-$370 depending on your bracket.

---

## Tax Refunds: You Are Not Getting Free Money

A **tax refund** is money the government gives back to you because your employer withheld more tax from your paychecks than you actually owed. This is important: a refund is not a bonus. It is your own money being returned to you, late, with no interest.

If you get a $3,000 refund in April, that means your paychecks were each about $250 too small throughout the year. You gave the government a $3,000 interest-free loan for 12 months. If that money had been in a high-yield savings account earning 4.5% APY, you would have earned roughly $135 in interest.

**What to actually do:** If you consistently get a large refund (over $500), update your W-4 to reduce withholding. You will get more money in each paycheck throughout the year. Aim for a refund close to $0 — or a small refund of $100-$200 as a buffer so you do not accidentally owe.

Some people argue they like the "forced savings" of a large refund. If that is you, consider setting up an automatic transfer to a savings account instead — same result, but you earn interest on your money.

---

## Tax Filing: Getting It Done

**Tax filing** is the process of submitting your tax return to the IRS (and your state, if applicable). The deadline is April 15 each year for most filers. If you cannot file on time, you can request a six-month extension — but this extends the deadline to *file*, not to *pay*. You still owe estimated taxes by April 15.

### How to File Your Taxes

For most young adults with straightforward income (one or two W-2s, no complex investments), filing is simple.

**Free options:**

- **IRS Free File:** If your income is below $84,000, you can file federal taxes for free through IRS-approved software at [irs.gov/freefile](https://www.irs.gov/freefile)
- **IRS Direct File:** The IRS now offers its own free filing tool for simple returns in participating states
- **Cash App Taxes (formerly Credit Karma Tax):** Free federal and state filing for most situations
- **Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA):** Free in-person tax prep for people earning under $67,000

**Paid options:**

- **TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxAct:** $0-$200+ depending on complexity. The free versions have limitations; they try to upsell you to paid tiers.
- **CPA or tax professional:** $200-$500+ for a full return. Worth it if you have complex income (1099 + W-2, investments, rental property).

### What You Need to File

- **W-2(s):** From every employer you worked for
- **1099(s):** For freelance, investment, or other non-wage income
- **1098 forms:** If you paid student loan interest or mortgage interest
- **Social Security number**
- **Bank account information** for direct deposit of your refund
- **Last year's tax return** (helpful for reference)

!!! warning "Do Not Ignore Tax Filing"
    Filing your taxes is not optional. Even if you think you do not earn enough to owe taxes, you should still file. You may be eligible for refundable credits like the EITC or the American Opportunity Tax Credit — but you only get them if you file. And if you owe taxes and do not file, penalties and interest start adding up immediately.

---

## Tax-Advantaged Accounts: The Legal Tax Cheat Codes

**Tax-advantaged accounts** are special accounts that the government has set up to encourage saving for retirement, healthcare, and education. The "advantage" is that they reduce, defer, or eliminate taxes on the money inside them. These are the most powerful tools in your tax optimization toolkit.

### Pre-Tax (Traditional) Accounts

These accounts let you deduct contributions from your taxable income *now*. You pay taxes later when you withdraw the money in retirement.

- **Traditional 401(k):** Contribute up to $23,500 in 2025 through your employer. If you contribute $5,000, your taxable income drops by $5,000 immediately.
- **Traditional IRA:** Contribute up to $7,000 in 2025. Deductibility depends on income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan.

### After-Tax (Roth) Accounts

These accounts use money you have already paid taxes on. The benefit is that all growth and withdrawals in retirement are **completely tax-free**.

- **Roth 401(k):** Same contribution limits as Traditional 401(k), but contributions are after-tax. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Roth IRA:** Contribute up to $7,000 in 2025 with after-tax money. Grows tax-free. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### Other Tax-Advantaged Accounts

- **Health Savings Account (HSA):** If you have a high-deductible health plan, you can contribute up to $4,300 (individual) in 2025. Triple tax advantage — contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free, and withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free.
- **529 Plan:** A savings account for education expenses. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified education costs are tax-free at the federal level.

### Traditional vs. Roth: Which Is Better for Young Adults?

For most young adults, **Roth accounts are the better choice**. Here is why:

- You are probably in a lower tax bracket now than you will be in retirement
- Paying taxes now at 10-12% is better than paying at 22-24% (or higher) in 30 years
- Roth IRAs let you withdraw your contributions (not earnings) penalty-free at any time — making them a flexible backup

If your employer offers a 401(k) match, always contribute enough to get the full match — that is free money regardless of Traditional vs. Roth. Then consider maxing out a Roth IRA.

## Where Your Money Should Go

Understanding taxes does not change the priority order, but it makes every priority more effective. Here is how taxes connect to the framework:

1. **Build your $1,000 starter emergency fund.** Keep it in a high-yield savings account. The interest is taxable, but at low income levels, the tax is minimal.
2. **Get your full employer 401(k) match.** Every dollar your employer matches is free money. Traditional 401(k) contributions also reduce your current tax bill.
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%).** Student loan interest (up to $2,500/year) is tax-deductible even if you take the standard deduction. Credit card interest is never deductible.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses.**
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025).** Growth and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. At your current low tax bracket, paying taxes now is a bargain.
6. **Invest in low-cost index funds.** Hold investments in tax-advantaged accounts when possible. In taxable accounts, long-term capital gains (assets held over one year) are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%).**
8. **Save for specific goals.** Use a 529 plan for education savings to avoid taxes on growth.

**The takeaway:** Tax-advantaged accounts are not just for retirement planning — they are a core part of your wealth-building strategy. Every dollar you put into a Roth IRA or HSA today is a dollar the government will never tax again.

## Common Mistakes

These mistakes cost young adults hundreds or thousands of dollars every year. Avoid all of them.

### Mistake 1: Thinking a Raise Puts You in a Worse Position

This is the bracket myth. If you earn $48,475 (the top of the 12% bracket) and get a $1,000 raise, only that additional $1,000 is taxed at 22%. You take home an extra $780 after federal tax on that raise — not less than before. A raise always increases your take-home pay.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Your 401(k) Match

If your employer matches 401(k) contributions up to 3% of your salary and you contribute 0%, you are leaving free money on the table. On a $50,000 salary, a 3% match is $1,500 per year your employer would give you for free. Over 30 years with investment growth, that is potentially $150,000+.

### Mistake 3: Not Filing Because You Think You Do Not Owe

Even if your income is too low to owe federal income tax, you may qualify for refundable credits worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. The EITC and American Opportunity Tax Credit can result in a refund even if your tax liability is zero — but only if you file.

### Mistake 4: Treating Your Tax Refund as a Windfall

A $3,000 refund means you overpaid by $250/month all year. Adjust your W-4 so you get that money in your paycheck and can invest it, save it, or pay down debt throughout the year instead of waiting for April.

### Mistake 5: Not Setting Aside Taxes on 1099 Income

If you freelance, drive rideshare, or do contract work, no taxes are withheld. Many new freelancers spend everything they earn and are shocked by a $4,000+ tax bill in April. Set aside 25-30% of every payment immediately.

### Mistake 6: Paying for Tax Software When You Can File for Free

If your income is below $84,000 and your tax situation is simple (W-2 income, standard deduction), you can file for free through IRS Free File or IRS Direct File. Do not pay $80-$200 for TurboTax when a free option does the same thing.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of tax concepts. Try to answer each question before revealing the answer.

??? question "1. You earn $55,000 and use the standard deduction ($15,000). What is your taxable income?"
    **$40,000.** You subtract the standard deduction from your gross income before applying tax brackets: \( \$55{,}000 - \$15{,}000 = \$40{,}000 \).

??? question "2. Your taxable income is $40,000. How much federal income tax do you owe?"
    **$4,561.50.** The first $11,925 is taxed at 10% ($1,192.50). The remaining $28,075 is taxed at 12% ($3,369.00). Total: $1,192.50 + $3,369.00 = **$4,561.50**.

??? question "3. What is the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit?"
    A **tax deduction** reduces your taxable income. A **tax credit** reduces your actual tax bill dollar-for-dollar. A $1,000 credit saves you $1,000 in taxes. A $1,000 deduction saves you only $120-$370 depending on your bracket. Credits are always more valuable.

??? question "4. You earn $48,475 and get a $5,000 raise. Your coworker says you will take home less money because you moved into the 22% bracket. Are they right?"
    **No.** Only the $5,000 above the 12% bracket threshold is taxed at 22%. You pay $1,100 in tax on that raise and keep $3,900. Your income below the threshold is still taxed at 10% and 12%. You always take home more money with a raise.

??? question "5. You do freelance design work and earn $15,000 on a 1099. How much should you set aside for taxes?"
    Set aside **25-30%**, or **$3,750-$4,500**. You owe federal income tax plus the full 15.3% self-employment tax (since no employer is splitting FICA with you). The exact amount depends on your other income and deductions, but 25-30% is a safe estimate.

??? question "6. Why are Roth accounts usually better for young adults than Traditional accounts?"
    Because most young adults are in a **low tax bracket now** (10-12%) and will likely be in a higher bracket later in their careers. With a Roth, you pay taxes at today's low rate and all future growth is tax-free. Paying 12% now beats paying 22-24% on withdrawals in retirement.

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Taxes** | Mandatory payments to federal, state, and local governments that fund public services. Calculated based on income, purchases, property, and other factors. |
| **Tax Brackets** | Income ranges that determine the percentage of federal income tax owed. The U.S. uses seven brackets ranging from 10% to 37% (2025). |
| **Marginal Tax Rate** | The tax rate applied to your last dollar of income — the highest bracket your income reaches. Not the rate on all your income. |
| **Federal Income Tax** | Tax paid to the U.S. government based on your taxable income. Calculated using progressive brackets after subtracting deductions. |
| **State Income Tax** | Tax paid to your state government. Ranges from 0% (nine states) to 13.3% (California). Some states use flat rates; others use brackets. |
| **FICA Taxes** | Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes that fund Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%). Total of 7.65% from your paycheck, matched by your employer. |
| **W-2 Form** | Annual document from your employer showing total wages earned and taxes withheld. Needed to file your tax return. Sent by January 31. |
| **W-4 Form** | Form you fill out when starting a job that tells your employer how much federal tax to withhold from each paycheck. |
| **1099 Form** | Tax document for non-employee income (freelance, contract work, investments). No taxes are withheld — you are responsible for paying them yourself. |
| **Tax Deductions** | Expenses that reduce your taxable income. A $1,000 deduction saves you $120-$370 depending on your tax bracket. |
| **Standard Deduction** | A flat amount subtracted from income before calculating taxes. $15,000 for single filers in 2025. Used by roughly 87% of taxpayers. |
| **Itemized Deductions** | Specific expenses listed individually instead of taking the standard deduction. Includes mortgage interest, charitable donations, and state/local taxes up to $10,000. |
| **Tax Credits** | Dollar-for-dollar reductions in your tax bill. A $1,000 credit saves you exactly $1,000 in taxes regardless of your bracket. |
| **Tax Refund** | Money returned to you because more tax was withheld from your paychecks than you actually owed. It is your own money being returned, not a bonus. |
| **Tax Filing** | The process of submitting your tax return to the IRS and your state. Due April 15 each year. Free filing options available for most young adults. |
| **Tax-Advantaged Accounts** | Special accounts (401(k), IRA, HSA, 529) that reduce, defer, or eliminate taxes on savings. The most powerful tool for building wealth over time. |

## What To Do This Week

You have read the theory. Now take action. Complete at least three of these items this week.

- [ ] **Find your most recent pay stub.** Look at the deductions section. Identify federal income tax, state income tax (if applicable), Social Security, and Medicare. Add them up and calculate what percentage of your gross pay goes to taxes.
- [ ] **Calculate your effective tax rate.** Use your gross income and the bracket math from this chapter. Compare your effective rate to your marginal rate — notice how different they are.
- [ ] **Check your W-4.** If you got a refund over $500 last year, consider adjusting your withholding to get more money per paycheck. If you owed money, increase your withholding.
- [ ] **Confirm you are getting your full 401(k) match.** Log into your employer's retirement portal and check your contribution percentage. If your employer matches up to 3% and you are contributing less than 3%, increase it today.
- [ ] **Open or fund a Roth IRA.** If you do not have one yet, open one at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard (no minimums at Fidelity and Schwab). Even $50 to start is a step forward.
- [ ] **Bookmark IRS Free File.** Go to [irs.gov/freefile](https://www.irs.gov/freefile) and check if you qualify. If tax season is coming up, start gathering your W-2s and any 1099s.
