## Introduction: Protecting What You Have Built

You have been working hard. You built your emergency fund, started paying down debt, maybe opened a Roth IRA. You are making real progress. Now imagine this: you get into a car accident, spend three days in the hospital, and get a bill for $87,000. Or your apartment floods and destroys your laptop, clothes, and furniture. Or you hurt your back and cannot work for four months.

Without insurance, any one of these events could wipe out years of financial progress in a single day. That emergency fund you worked so hard to build? Gone in one hospital visit.

Insurance is not exciting. Nobody wakes up thrilled to pay their car insurance bill. But insurance is the thing that keeps a bad day from becoming a financial catastrophe. Think of it as a wall around everything you have built. Your emergency fund handles the small stuff -- a $500 car repair, a $200 urgent care visit. Insurance handles the big stuff -- the $87,000 hospital stay, the $50,000 lawsuit after a car accident, the years of lost income from a serious injury.

This chapter covers the five types of insurance that matter most for young adults: health, auto, renters, life, and disability. You will learn what each one does, what it costs, and exactly when you need it.

## How Insurance Works: Premiums, Deductibles, and the Tradeoff

Before we dive into specific types, you need to understand two terms that apply to every kind of insurance.

An **insurance premium** is the amount you pay regularly (usually monthly) to keep your insurance active. Think of it like a subscription fee. Whether you use the insurance or not, you pay your premium to stay covered. A health insurance premium might be $250 per month. A renters insurance premium might be $20 per month.

An **insurance deductible** is the amount you pay out of your own pocket before your insurance starts covering costs. If you have a $1,000 deductible on your health insurance and you get a $5,000 medical bill, you pay the first $1,000 and your insurance covers the remaining $4,000 (minus any copays or coinsurance, which we will cover shortly).

Here is the key relationship: **higher deductible = lower premium, and lower deductible = higher premium.** This is because when you agree to pay more out of pocket before insurance kicks in, the insurance company takes on less risk, so they charge you less each month.

\[
\text{Higher deductible} \rightarrow \text{Lower monthly premium}
\]

\[
\text{Lower deductible} \rightarrow \text{Higher monthly premium}
\]

This creates a tradeoff. Do you want to pay more each month for peace of mind (low deductible), or pay less each month and accept more risk if something happens (high deductible)?

**For healthy young adults:** A higher deductible plan often makes sense. You are less likely to have major medical expenses, so paying a lower premium each month saves you money most years. Just make sure you have enough in your emergency fund to cover the deductible if something does happen.

### MicroSim: Insurance Deductible vs Premium Calculator

Use this calculator to see how different deductible levels affect your total annual cost. Adjust the deductible and see how your premium changes, then compare the breakeven point -- the medical expense level where each plan costs the same.

<iframe src="../../sims/insurance-deductible-vs-premium/main.html" width="100%" height="500" style="border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:8px;" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Try comparing a $500 deductible plan against a $2,000 deductible plan. Notice that if you have a healthy year with low medical costs, the high-deductible plan saves you money. But if you have a major medical event, the low-deductible plan can come out ahead.

## Insurance Types at a Glance

Before we go deep on each type, here is the big picture. This table shows which types of insurance you likely need right now and what they typically cost.

| Insurance Type | Who Needs It? | Typical Monthly Cost | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Health Insurance | Everyone | $0-$400+ (depends on source) | Doctor visits, hospital stays, prescriptions, preventive care |
| Auto Insurance | Anyone who drives | $150-$300 (varies by state/age) | Car accidents, liability, theft, damage |
| Renters Insurance | Anyone who rents | $15-$30 | Personal belongings, liability, temporary housing |
| Life Insurance (Term) | Anyone with dependents | $15-$30 (for young, healthy adults) | Pays your family if you die |
| Disability Insurance | Anyone who earns income | $25-$60 (or free through employer) | Replaces income if you cannot work |

If you are a 23-year-old renting an apartment and driving a car, you likely need health insurance, auto insurance, and renters insurance right now. Life insurance and disability insurance become more important as you take on more responsibility -- a spouse, kids, a mortgage.

## Health Insurance: Your Most Important Coverage

**Health insurance** pays for medical care -- doctor visits, hospital stays, surgery, prescriptions, lab work, and preventive care like annual checkups and vaccinations. In the United States, medical costs without insurance can be devastating. A broken arm can cost $2,500 to $7,500. An appendectomy averages $33,000. A three-day hospital stay can easily exceed $30,000.

Health insurance protects you from these catastrophic costs. Beyond the deductible and premium, health insurance has a few extra terms worth knowing:

- **Copay**: A fixed amount you pay for a specific service. For example, $25 for a doctor visit or $15 for a prescription. You pay this on top of your premium.
- **Coinsurance**: A percentage you pay after meeting your deductible. If your coinsurance is 20% and you have a $10,000 bill after meeting your deductible, you pay $2,000 and insurance pays $8,000.
- **Out-of-pocket maximum**: The most you will pay in a year. Once you hit this number, insurance covers 100% of the rest. For 2025, the ACA (Affordable Care Act) limits this to $9,200 for an individual.

As a young adult, you have three main paths to health insurance coverage. Let us walk through each one.

### Path 1: Stay on Your Parents' Plan Until 26

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, you can stay on a **parent's health insurance plan until you turn 26**, regardless of whether you are married, financially independent, living on your own, in school, or employed. This applies even if your employer offers you a plan.

This is usually the best option for young adults. Here is why:

- **Cost to you: often $0.** Your parents are already paying for a family plan. Adding you (or keeping you on) typically costs them little to nothing extra. Some family plans charge a small amount for dependents, but it is almost always cheaper than buying your own coverage.
- **Coverage is usually good.** Employer-sponsored plans (the kind most parents have) tend to have broader provider networks and lower deductibles than plans you would buy on your own.
- **It is simple.** No applications, no shopping, no hassle. You are just on the plan.

**When does this NOT work?**

- You are over 26. Coverage ends at the end of the month you turn 26 (or at the end of the year in some states).
- Your parents do not have health insurance.
- Your parents' plan has a very high cost for dependents.
- You live in a different state and their plan's network does not cover providers near you.

!!! tip "Turning 26 Soon?"
    If you are approaching 26, start looking at your other options two to three months before your birthday. Losing your parents' coverage qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period on the Health Insurance Marketplace, meaning you can sign up outside the normal open enrollment window. Do not wait until the day you lose coverage.

### Path 2: Employer Health Plan

An **employer health plan** is health insurance your employer offers as a benefit. If your employer offers coverage, they typically pay 70-80% of the premium and you pay the rest through payroll deductions (money taken out of your paycheck before you receive it).

This is usually the second-best option for young adults. The math works in your favor because your employer is subsidizing most of the cost.

| Feature | Typical Employer Plan |
|---|---|
| Your share of premium | $100-$250/month |
| Employer's share of premium | $400-$600/month |
| Deductible | $1,000-$3,000 |
| Copay (doctor visit) | $20-$40 |
| Out-of-pocket max | $5,000-$8,000 |

**Choosing between plan options:** Many employers offer two or three plan choices, usually a lower-deductible plan (higher premium) and a higher-deductible plan (lower premium, sometimes called an HDHP -- High Deductible Health Plan). If you are young and healthy, the HDHP often makes sense. Some HDHPs come with an HSA (Health Savings Account), which lets you save pre-tax money for medical expenses -- a triple tax advantage that is worth using if available.

**Important:** If your employer offers health insurance and your parents' plan is also available, compare the costs and coverage. If your parents' plan is free to you with good coverage, it usually wins until you turn 26.

### Path 3: Health Insurance Marketplace

The **Health Insurance Marketplace** (also called the "Exchange" or healthcare.gov) is where you buy individual health insurance if you do not have access to a parent's plan or an employer plan. The Marketplace was created by the Affordable Care Act to help people shop for and compare insurance plans.

Plans are categorized by metal tier:

- **Bronze**: Lowest premiums, highest deductibles. Good if you are healthy and want catastrophic coverage.
- **Silver**: Moderate premiums and deductibles. Best value if you qualify for cost-sharing reductions.
- **Gold**: Higher premiums, lower deductibles. Good if you expect frequent medical visits.
- **Platinum**: Highest premiums, lowest deductibles. Rarely worth it for young adults.

**Subsidies:** Depending on your income, you may qualify for premium tax credits that reduce your monthly cost significantly. A 24-year-old earning $35,000 per year might pay $100-$200/month for a Silver plan after subsidies, rather than $350-$400 without them. You will not know your true cost until you apply.

| Health Insurance Path | Typical Cost to You | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Parents' plan (under 26) | $0/month | Ages 18-25, best option if available |
| Employer plan | $100-$250/month | Anyone with employer coverage |
| Marketplace (with subsidies) | $100-$300/month | Self-employed, no employer coverage |
| Marketplace (no subsidies) | $300-$500/month | Higher earners without employer coverage |
| No insurance | $0/month... until you get sick | Nobody. This is never the right answer. |

!!! warning "Going Without Health Insurance Is a Gamble You Will Lose"
    Some young adults think, "I'm healthy, I don't need insurance." Here is the problem: insurance is not for the expected -- it is for the unexpected. You do not plan to break your leg, get appendicitis, or discover a health condition. A single ER visit without insurance can cost $3,000-$10,000. A surgery can cost $50,000+. Going uninsured is not saving money. It is gambling your entire financial future on never getting hurt or sick.

## Auto Insurance: Required If You Drive

**Auto insurance** protects you financially if you are in a car accident, if your car is damaged, or if someone is injured. In almost every state, carrying auto insurance is legally required.

Auto insurance has several components, and understanding them helps you pick the right coverage without overpaying:

- **Liability coverage**: Pays for the other person's injuries and property damage if you cause an accident. This is the legally required part. Most states require minimum amounts like 25/50/25 (which means $25,000 per person for injuries, $50,000 total for injuries per accident, $25,000 for property damage). Experts recommend carrying at least 100/300/100.
- **Collision coverage**: Pays to repair your car after an accident, regardless of who is at fault.
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Pays for non-accident damage -- theft, hail, vandalism, hitting a deer.
- **Uninsured/underinsured motorist**: Covers you if the other driver does not have insurance or does not have enough.

### What Auto Insurance Costs for Young Adults

Auto insurance is expensive when you are young, especially under 25. Insurance companies charge more because younger drivers statistically have more accidents. Here are typical ranges:

| Factor | Impact on Cost |
|---|---|
| Age under 25 | Higher premiums (often 50-100% more than age 30+) |
| Clean driving record | Lower premiums |
| Good credit score | Lower premiums (in most states) |
| Higher deductible | Lower premiums |
| Urban area | Higher than rural |
| Type of car | Sports cars cost more; older sedans cost less |

A 22-year-old with a clean record might pay $150-$300 per month. The same person at 30 might pay $80-$150. Age is the biggest factor you cannot control, but there are things you can do:

- **Shop around every year.** Prices vary dramatically between companies. Get three to five quotes.
- **Raise your deductible.** Going from a $500 to a $1,000 deductible can save 15-25% on your premium. Just keep enough in your emergency fund to cover that deductible.
- **Ask about discounts.** Good student, defensive driving course, bundling with renters insurance, low mileage, and paperless billing discounts can add up.
- **Drive an older, practical car.** Insurance on a $5,000 used Honda Civic is much cheaper than on a $35,000 new sports car.

!!! tip "Drop Collision and Comprehensive on Older Cars"
    If your car is worth less than $5,000, consider dropping collision and comprehensive coverage. You are paying to insure a car that the insurance company would total (declare a loss) for a relatively small payout anyway. Keep your liability coverage -- that is non-negotiable.

## Renters Insurance: The Best Deal in Insurance

**Renters insurance** protects your personal belongings if they are stolen, damaged, or destroyed. It also provides liability coverage if someone is injured in your apartment. And it covers temporary living expenses if your place becomes uninhabitable (like after a fire or flood).

Here is the thing about renters insurance: it is absurdly cheap for what you get. We are talking about **$15 to $30 per month for $30,000 or more in coverage**. That is roughly the cost of a single fast food meal per week.

Yet only about 55% of renters have it. Many people assume their landlord's insurance covers their stuff. It does not. Your landlord's insurance covers the building. If a pipe bursts and destroys your laptop, TV, furniture, and wardrobe, your landlord's insurance pays to fix the floor. Your stuff? That is on you -- unless you have renters insurance.

### What Renters Insurance Covers

Here is a breakdown of what $30,000 in renters insurance coverage might look like:

| Category | Estimated Value | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Electronics | $5,000 | Laptop, phone, TV, gaming console, headphones |
| Furniture | $6,000 | Bed, desk, couch, dresser, bookshelf |
| Clothing | $4,000 | All your clothes, shoes, coats |
| Kitchen items | $2,000 | Appliances, cookware, dishes |
| Personal items | $3,000 | Jewelry, books, sports gear, musical instruments |
| Other | $10,000 | Additional buffer for items you underestimate |
| **Total** | **$30,000** | |

Most people underestimate how much their stuff is worth. Walk through your apartment mentally and add up what it would cost to replace everything. That number is usually higher than you expect.

**Liability coverage** is the other critical piece. Renters insurance typically includes $100,000 in personal liability coverage. If a guest slips and falls in your apartment and sues you, your renters insurance covers it. Without it, you are paying out of pocket -- and lawsuits are not cheap.

**How to get renters insurance:** Call whatever company insures your car and ask to bundle. Bundling auto and renters insurance often saves 5-15% on both policies. You can also get quotes online from Lemonade, State Farm, Progressive, or GEICO in about five minutes.

!!! note "Renters Insurance in Action"
    Scenario: Your apartment building has a kitchen fire. It does not reach your unit, but the smoke and water damage ruins your furniture, clothes, and electronics. Total damage to your belongings: $12,000. Without renters insurance, you eat the entire $12,000 loss. With a $20/month renters policy and a $500 deductible, you pay $500 and insurance covers the remaining $11,500. You also get temporary housing covered while your unit is repaired. All for $20 a month.

## Life Insurance: Do You Need It Yet?

**Life insurance** pays a lump sum to your beneficiaries (the people you name on the policy) when you die. It exists to replace your income and support the people who depend on you financially.

Here is the honest answer for most young adults: **if nobody depends on your income, you probably do not need life insurance yet.** If you are 23, single, no kids, and no one would face financial hardship if you died tomorrow, life insurance is not a priority. Your money is better spent on your emergency fund, Roth IRA, or paying off debt.

**You DO need life insurance if:**

- You have a spouse or partner who depends on your income
- You have children
- You have co-signed a loan with someone (like a parent co-signing your student loans)
- Someone else would be responsible for your debts or final expenses

When the time comes, you need to understand the two main types.

### Term vs Whole Life Insurance

**Term life insurance** covers you for a specific period (the "term") -- usually 10, 20, or 30 years. If you die during that term, your beneficiaries get the payout. If you survive the term, the policy expires and you get nothing back. It is pure protection, like car insurance for your life.

**Whole life insurance** (a type of permanent life insurance) covers you for your entire life and includes a "cash value" component that acts like a savings account. Part of your premium goes toward the death benefit and part goes into this cash value that grows slowly over time.

Here is the bottom line: **term life insurance is almost always the better choice for young adults.** It is dramatically cheaper and provides the coverage you actually need.

| Feature | Term Life Insurance | Whole Life Insurance |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage period | 10, 20, or 30 years | Your entire life |
| Monthly cost (healthy 28-year-old, $500K coverage) | $20-$30/month | $300-$500/month |
| Cash value component | No | Yes (grows slowly) |
| Complexity | Simple | Complex (investment + insurance) |
| Good for young adults? | **Yes** | No (too expensive, poor investment) |
| Best use case | Protect dependents during earning years | Estate planning for wealthy individuals |

A 28-year-old can get a 30-year, $500,000 term life policy for about $25 per month. That same person would pay $350+ per month for a comparable whole life policy. That is a **$325 per month difference** -- money you could invest in your Roth IRA, where it would grow far better than the cash value inside a whole life policy.

The whole life insurance industry is big and profitable because agents earn massive commissions selling whole life policies. If a financial advisor or insurance agent pushes you hard toward whole life, understand they may be earning 50-100% of your first year's premium as their commission. That does not mean they are bad people, but it means their incentive is not aligned with your best interest.

!!! tip "The 'Buy Term and Invest the Difference' Strategy"
    Buy a term life policy for $25/month instead of whole life at $350/month. Take the $325 difference and invest it in your Roth IRA or index funds. Over 30 years at an average 10% return, that $325/month becomes approximately **$720,000**. The cash value of the whole life policy after 30 years? Typically $150,000-$200,000. Term wins, and it is not close.

</details>

As your life gets more complex, your insurance needs grow. The key is adding coverage as your responsibilities increase, not before and not after.

## Disability Insurance: Protecting Your Biggest Asset

**Disability insurance** replaces a portion of your income if you become unable to work due to illness or injury. Most policies pay 50-70% of your pre-disability income.

Here is a statistic that surprises most people: a 20-year-old worker has about a 25% chance of becoming disabled for 90 days or more before reaching age 67. One in four. That is not a rare event. And yet most young adults have never thought about disability insurance.

Your ability to earn income is your most valuable financial asset. If you are 25 and earning $50,000 per year, and you will work for 40 more years with raises, your total lifetime earnings could exceed $3 million. Disability insurance protects that earning power.

**Two types of disability insurance:**

- **Short-term disability (STD)**: Covers you for a few weeks to six months. Often provided by employers at no cost.
- **Long-term disability (LTD)**: Kicks in after short-term coverage ends and can last years or until retirement. This is the more important one.

**How to get it:** Check if your employer offers disability coverage as a benefit. Many employers provide short-term disability for free and offer long-term disability at a low group rate. If your employer offers it, take it. If not, you can buy an individual policy, but it is more expensive -- typically $25-$60 per month depending on your income and occupation.

If you can only afford one type of insurance beyond health and auto, and you do not have dependents, **disability insurance arguably matters more than life insurance.** Life insurance pays out when you die. Disability insurance pays out when you are alive but cannot earn money -- which is financially much harder to survive.

## The Deductible-Premium Tradeoff in Practice

Now that you understand both terms, let us see how the tradeoff works with real numbers across different insurance types.

**Health insurance example:**

| Plan | Monthly Premium | Annual Premium | Deductible | You Pay If You Have a $5,000 Medical Bill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan A (Low deductible) | $350 | $4,200 | $500 | $500 deductible + $4,200 premiums = **$4,700** |
| Plan B (High deductible) | $200 | $2,400 | $2,000 | $2,000 deductible + $2,400 premiums = **$4,400** |

In this example, Plan B (high deductible) saves you $300 even when you have a major medical bill. And in a healthy year with no big bills? Plan B saves you $1,800 in premiums.

The breakeven math looks like this:

\[
\text{Premium savings per year} = (\$350 - \$200) \times 12 = \$1{,}800
\]

\[
\text{Extra deductible risk} = \$2{,}000 - \$500 = \$1{,}500
\]

Since the premium savings (\$1,800) exceed the extra deductible risk (\$1,500), the high-deductible plan comes out ahead as long as you do not have major medical expenses every single year. For a healthy young adult, the high-deductible plan is often the smarter choice.

**The golden rule:** Never choose a deductible higher than what you can afford to pay. If you pick a $3,000 deductible but only have $500 in savings, you are gambling. Make sure your emergency fund can cover your deductible.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Insurance fits into your broader financial plan. Here is how it all connects:

1. **Build $1,000 starter emergency fund** -- Your first line of defense against small emergencies.
2. **Get your full employer 401(k) match** -- Free money from your employer.
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** -- Credit cards, payday loans.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses** -- Your full safety net.
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** -- Tax-free retirement growth.
6. **Invest in low-cost index funds** -- Long-term wealth building.
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** -- Car loans, some student loans.
8. **Save for specific goals** -- House down payment, wedding, etc.

**Where does insurance fit?** Insurance is not a numbered priority -- it is a constant. It runs alongside everything else. You should have health insurance, auto insurance (if you drive), and renters insurance (if you rent) at all times, even while you are working through Priorities #1 through #8. These are monthly expenses built into your budget, not competing goals.

Think of it this way: your emergency fund is the castle. Insurance is the moat around the castle. You need both. The emergency fund handles the $500 car repair. Insurance handles the $50,000 hospital bill. Together, they form your complete financial safety net.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Skipping renters insurance because "my landlord covers it."** Your landlord's insurance covers the building structure. It does not cover a single thing you own. For $15-$30 per month, you protect tens of thousands of dollars in belongings plus get liability coverage. There is no valid excuse to skip this.

**Mistake #2: Going without health insurance because "I'm young and healthy."** You are young and healthy until you are not. A single ER visit for a broken bone can cost $5,000-$10,000. An emergency appendectomy averages $33,000. Health insurance is not optional -- it is the foundation of your financial protection.

**Mistake #3: Buying whole life insurance when term will do.** Whole life insurance costs 10-15 times more than term life for the same death benefit. The "cash value" component grows slowly and has high fees. Buy term life insurance when you have dependents and invest the difference. You will come out significantly ahead.

**Mistake #4: Choosing the lowest deductible possible.** A low deductible feels safe but costs you every single month in higher premiums. If you are healthy and have an emergency fund, a higher deductible plan often saves you hundreds or thousands of dollars per year.

**Mistake #5: Never shopping around.** Insurance prices vary wildly between companies. Get quotes from at least three providers when you buy or renew any policy. Loyalty to one company rarely pays off -- switching can save 20-30%.

**Mistake #6: Ignoring disability insurance.** You have a 1-in-4 chance of a significant disability before retirement. If your employer offers long-term disability coverage, take it. Your income is your most valuable asset, and disability insurance is the only way to protect it.

**Mistake #7: Waiting to add life insurance until it is too late.** Life insurance premiums are based on your age and health at the time you buy. A 28-year-old pays far less than a 38-year-old, and a healthy person pays far less than someone with health conditions. If you have dependents or plan to start a family soon, lock in a term life policy while you are young and healthy.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of insurance and risk protection.

??? question "1. What is the relationship between deductibles and premiums?"
    **Higher deductible = lower premium, and lower deductible = higher premium.** When you agree to pay more out of pocket before insurance kicks in, the insurance company charges you less each month. For healthy young adults with an emergency fund, a higher deductible plan often saves money.

??? question "2. You are 24 years old. What is usually the best health insurance option?"
    **Stay on your parents' health insurance plan.** The Affordable Care Act allows you to remain on a parent's plan until age 26, regardless of your employment, marital status, or living situation. This is typically free or very low cost and usually provides good coverage.

??? question "3. Your apartment is broken into and your $1,500 laptop, $800 TV, and $600 in clothing are stolen. You have renters insurance with a $500 deductible. How much do you get back?"
    **$2,400.** Your total loss is $2,900 ($1,500 + $800 + $600). You pay the $500 deductible, and insurance reimburses the remaining $2,400. Without renters insurance, you would lose the full $2,900.

??? question "4. What is the main difference between term and whole life insurance?"
    **Term life covers you for a specific period (10, 20, or 30 years) at a low cost. Whole life covers you forever but costs 10-15 times more and includes a cash value component that grows slowly.** For young adults, term life is almost always the better and more affordable choice. Buy term and invest the difference.

??? question "5. A 28-year-old with a spouse and new baby needs life insurance. What should they buy?"
    **A 20-or 30-year term life insurance policy.** This covers the years when their family is most financially vulnerable (while the children are growing up and the mortgage is being paid). A $500,000 term policy for a healthy 28-year-old costs about $20-$30/month, compared to $300-$500/month for whole life.

??? question "6. Why is disability insurance important for young adults?"
    **A 20-year-old has about a 25% chance of becoming disabled for 90 or more days before age 67.** Disability insurance replaces 50-70% of your income if you cannot work due to illness or injury. Your ability to earn income is your most valuable asset, and disability insurance is the only way to protect it.

## Key Terms

- **Health Insurance**: Coverage that pays for medical care including doctor visits, hospital stays, prescriptions, and preventive care. In the US, going without health insurance means exposure to potentially devastating medical bills that can reach tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

- **Employer Health Plan**: Health insurance provided through your job, where the employer typically pays 70-80% of the premium and the remainder is deducted from your paycheck. Usually the second-best option for young adults after a parent's plan.

- **Health Marketplace**: The government-run exchange (healthcare.gov) where individuals can shop for and compare health insurance plans. Plans are organized by metal tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) and income-based subsidies may reduce your cost.

- **Parents Plan Until 26**: A provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to remain on a parent's health insurance plan until they turn 26, regardless of marital status, employment, financial independence, or whether they live with their parents. Usually the cheapest and simplest option.

- **Auto Insurance**: Coverage that protects you financially in car accidents, covering liability (damage you cause to others), collision (damage to your car), comprehensive (non-accident damage like theft or hail), and uninsured motorist protection. Required by law in almost every state.

- **Renters Insurance**: Low-cost coverage (typically $15-$30/month) that protects your personal belongings against theft, fire, and damage, provides personal liability coverage, and pays for temporary housing if your rental becomes uninhabitable. Does not duplicate your landlord's insurance, which only covers the building.

- **Life Insurance**: Coverage that pays a lump sum (the death benefit) to your named beneficiaries when you die. Designed to replace your income and support people who depend on you financially. Most relevant when you have a spouse, children, or co-signed debts.

- **Term vs Whole Life**: The two main types of life insurance. Term life covers a specific period (10-30 years) at low cost with no cash value. Whole life covers your entire life but costs 10-15 times more and includes a slow-growing cash value component. For young adults, term life is almost always the better choice.

- **Disability Insurance**: Coverage that replaces a portion (typically 50-70%) of your income if you become unable to work due to illness or injury. Comes in short-term (weeks to months) and long-term (years to retirement) varieties. Protects your most valuable asset: your ability to earn income.

- **Insurance Deductible**: The amount you pay out of your own pocket before insurance coverage kicks in. A $1,000 deductible means you pay the first $1,000 of any claim, and insurance covers the rest (subject to copays or coinsurance). Higher deductibles mean lower premiums.

- **Insurance Premium**: The regular payment (usually monthly) you make to keep your insurance policy active. You pay this whether or not you file a claim. Lower deductibles result in higher premiums, and vice versa.

## What To Do This Week

Here is your action plan. Work through these steps in order.

- [ ] **Day 1**: Figure out your current health insurance situation. Are you on your parents' plan? An employer plan? No plan at all? If you are under 26 and your parents have insurance, confirm you are on their plan. If you are uninsured, go to healthcare.gov and explore your options today.
- [ ] **Day 2**: Check if you have renters insurance. If you rent and do not have it, get quotes from three providers (your auto insurance company, Lemonade, and one other). This takes about 10 minutes and costs $15-$30/month for peace of mind on tens of thousands of dollars of your belongings.
- [ ] **Day 3**: Review your auto insurance (if you drive). When did you last shop around? Get quotes from two or three competitors. Check if you qualify for any discounts you are not using. Consider raising your deductible if your emergency fund can cover it.
- [ ] **Day 4**: Check your employer benefits for disability insurance. If your employer offers long-term disability coverage, sign up for it during your next open enrollment period. If you are self-employed, get a quote for an individual policy.
- [ ] **Day 5**: Walk through your apartment and estimate the replacement value of everything you own. Electronics, furniture, clothing, kitchen items, everything. Write down the total. This number is why renters insurance exists.
- [ ] **Weekend**: If you have dependents (spouse, kids, co-signed loans), research term life insurance. Get quotes from three providers for a 20-year or 30-year term policy. A healthy person under 30 can typically get $500,000 in coverage for $20-$30/month.

Insurance is not glamorous, but it is the wall that protects everything else you are building. Get the right coverage in place now, and you will never have to worry about a single bad day destroying years of financial progress.
