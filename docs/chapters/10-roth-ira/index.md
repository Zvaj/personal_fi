## Introduction: The Most Powerful Account You Are Not Using

If you are in your twenties and you do only one thing after reading this book, make it this: open a Roth IRA and start putting money into it. Today. Not next month. Not when you "make more money." Today.

Here is why this is so urgent. A 22-year-old who invests $7,000 per year in a Roth IRA until age 65 will end up with approximately **$3.2 million**. A 32-year-old who does the exact same thing -- same amount, same investments, same retirement age -- ends up with approximately **$1.2 million**. That is a $2 million difference caused by waiting just ten years.

Let that sink in. Ten years of delay costs you two million dollars. And that $3.2 million? It is **completely tax-free** when you withdraw it in retirement. You will not owe a single dollar to the IRS on any of it.

The Roth IRA is Priority #5 in your financial plan (after your starter emergency fund, 401(k) match, paying off high-interest debt, and building your full emergency fund). But if you have already checked off Priorities #1 through #4, this is the single most impactful financial action you can take right now.

## What Is a Roth IRA?

A **Roth IRA** is a special type of retirement investment account. IRA stands for Individual Retirement Arrangement (most people say "Individual Retirement Account," which is close enough). The "Roth" part comes from Senator William Roth, who helped create this account type in 1997.

Here is how it works in plain English: you put money in that you have already paid taxes on, your investments grow over the years, and when you pull the money out in retirement, you pay zero taxes on any of it -- not on your original contributions, and not on the growth. If you invest $7,000 and it grows to $70,000 over decades, you get all $70,000 without owing a cent in taxes.

Compare that to a regular investment account (called a brokerage account), where you would owe taxes on your gains every time you sell. The Roth IRA is like a tax-free shield around your investments.

## Roth vs Traditional IRA: Pay Taxes Now vs Pay Taxes Later

A **Traditional IRA** is the other major type of IRA. The key difference is simple: with a Roth, you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later. With a Traditional, you get a tax break now and pay taxes when you withdraw later.

Think of it like a deal with the IRS. The Roth deal is: "I'll pay my taxes on this money right now, and in exchange, you promise to never tax it again -- not the growth, not the withdrawals, nothing." The Traditional deal is: "Let me skip taxes on this money today, and I'll pay taxes on everything when I take it out in retirement."

For most young adults, the **Roth is the better choice**. Here is why: you are probably in a lower tax bracket right now than you will be in 30 or 40 years. Paying taxes on your income at today's lower rate, then letting decades of growth happen completely tax-free, is almost always the smarter move. You are locking in a low tax rate on money that could grow enormously.

| Feature | Roth IRA | Traditional IRA |
|---|---|---|
| Tax break when you contribute | No (you use after-tax money) | Yes (contributions may be tax-deductible) |
| Tax on growth | None | Deferred (you pay when you withdraw) |
| Tax on withdrawals in retirement | **None (tax-free!)** | Yes (taxed as ordinary income) |
| Contribution limit (2025) | $7,000/year (under age 50) | $7,000/year (under age 50) |
| Income limit to contribute | $150,000 single / $236,000 married (2025) | No income limit (but tax deduction may be limited) |
| Required minimum distributions (RMDs) | **No** (never forced to withdraw) | Yes (must start withdrawing at age 73) |
| Withdraw contributions early | **Yes, anytime, penalty-free** | Penalties before age 59.5 |
| Best for | Young adults in lower tax brackets | Higher earners who want a tax break today |

!!! tip "The Quick Rule"
    If you expect to earn more money in the future than you do now (and most young adults should), choose the Roth IRA. Pay the lower tax rate today and enjoy tax-free growth for decades.

## IRA Contribution Limits

**IRA contribution limits** are the maximum amount the IRS allows you to put into your IRA each year. For 2025, the limit is **$7,000 per year** if you are under age 50. If you are 50 or older, you get a "catch-up" contribution of an extra $1,000, bringing the total to $8,000.

A few important rules about contributions:

- The $7,000 limit is a **combined limit** across all your IRAs. If you have both a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA, you can only put $7,000 total across both of them, not $7,000 into each.
- You can only contribute **earned income**. This means money from a job, self-employment, or freelancing. Investment income, gifts, and allowances do not count. If you earned $5,000 from a part-time job, your limit for that year is $5,000 (not $7,000).
- You have until the **tax filing deadline** (usually April 15 of the following year) to make contributions for a given year. So you have until April 15, 2026, to make your 2025 contributions.

Can you afford $7,000 per year? That breaks down to about $583 per month or $269 per biweekly paycheck. If that sounds like a lot, remember: you do not have to max it out. Putting in $100 per month ($1,200 per year) is infinitely better than putting in nothing. Start where you can and increase as your income grows.

\[
\$7{,}000 \div 12 \text{ months} = \$583.33 \text{ per month}
\]

\[
\$7{,}000 \div 26 \text{ pay periods} = \$269.23 \text{ per paycheck (biweekly)}
\]

## Tax-Free Growth: The Roth IRA Superpower

**Tax-free growth** means that your investments inside a Roth IRA grow without ever being taxed. Not when they earn dividends, not when you sell one investment and buy another, and not when you withdraw the money in retirement. The growth is invisible to the IRS.

Here is a concrete example. Say you contribute $7,000 to your Roth IRA this year and invest it in a total stock market index fund. Over the next 40 years, that single $7,000 grows at an average of 10% per year (the historical average of the US stock market). By the time you are ready to retire, that $7,000 has turned into approximately $314,000.

\[
\$7{,}000 \times (1.10)^{40} = \$7{,}000 \times 45.26 = \$316{,}820
\]

In a regular taxable brokerage account, you would owe capital gains taxes on the $309,820 in growth. At a 15% long-term capital gains rate, that is roughly $46,500 in taxes. In your Roth IRA, you owe **$0**. That $46,500 stays in your pocket.

Now multiply this across 43 years of annual $7,000 contributions. The tax savings become enormous -- potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime.

## Tax-Deferred Growth: How Traditional IRAs Work

**Tax-deferred growth** means your investments grow without being taxed right now, but you will owe taxes when you withdraw the money later. This is how Traditional IRAs (and 401(k)s, which we cover in Chapter 11) work.

The word "deferred" means postponed or delayed. You are not avoiding taxes; you are delaying them. When you retire and start pulling money out, every dollar you withdraw is taxed as ordinary income, just like a paycheck.

For a young adult in a low tax bracket, tax-deferred growth is usually less valuable than tax-free growth. If you are in the 12% tax bracket today and expect to be in the 22% or 24% bracket when you retire, you would rather pay 12% now (Roth) than 22% later (Traditional).

In this example, the Roth IRA holder keeps about $69,000 more. This is why the Roth is usually the better deal for young adults who expect their income (and tax bracket) to increase over time.

## The Age 22 vs Age 32 Comparison: Why Starting NOW Matters

This is the most important section of this chapter. If you remember nothing else, remember these numbers.

Let us compare two people. Both invest $7,000 per year into a Roth IRA. Both earn an average 10% annual return (the historical average of the S&P 500). Both retire at age 65. The only difference? One starts at 22 and the other starts at 32.

| | Alex (starts at 22) | Jordan (starts at 32) |
|---|---|---|
| Annual contribution | $7,000 | $7,000 |
| Years of investing | 43 years | 33 years |
| Total money put in | $301,000 | $231,000 |
| Average annual return | 10% | 10% |
| **Total at age 65** | **~$3,210,000** | **~$1,200,000** |
| Tax-free withdrawals | Yes | Yes |

Alex puts in only $70,000 more than Jordan ($301,000 vs $231,000). But Alex ends up with roughly **$2 million more** at retirement. That extra $70,000 in contributions turned into $2 million of additional wealth because of compound growth over those extra ten years.

\[
\text{Alex's total} = \$7{,}000 \times \frac{(1.10)^{43} - 1}{0.10} = \$7{,}000 \times 456.79 \approx \$3{,}197{,}500
\]

\[
\text{Jordan's total} = \$7{,}000 \times \frac{(1.10)^{33} - 1}{0.10} = \$7{,}000 \times 172.07 \approx \$1{,}204{,}500
\]

Here is what makes this even more mind-blowing: Alex contributed only 9.4% of the final amount. The other 90.6% came from investment growth. Time is doing the heavy lifting, not the contributions. That is why starting early is everything.

Try setting one scenario to age 22 and another to age 32. Watch the gap between the two lines widen as the years pass. That widening gap is compound growth in action, and it is why every year you wait costs you real money.

## Step-by-Step: Opening a Roth IRA at Fidelity

**Fidelity Investments** is one of the two most recommended brokerages for opening a Roth IRA. It charges no account fees, no minimums to open, and offers excellent low-cost index funds. Here is exactly what to do.

**What you will need before you start:**

- Your Social Security number
- Your bank account and routing number (for linking your checking account)
- Your employer's name and address
- A valid government ID
- About 15 minutes

**Step 1:** Go to [fidelity.com](https://www.fidelity.com) and click "Open an Account."

**Step 2:** Select "Roth IRA" from the account type options. Do not select "Traditional IRA" or "Brokerage Account." You want the Roth IRA specifically.

**Step 3:** Fill in your personal information: name, date of birth, Social Security number, address, and employment details. This is standard -- every brokerage is required to collect this by law.

**Step 4:** Link your bank account. Enter your checking account's routing number and account number. This is how you will transfer money into your Roth IRA.

**Step 5:** Set up your initial contribution. You can start with as little as $1. Fidelity has no minimum investment requirement. If you can, set up automatic monthly contributions. Even $100/month ($1,200/year) gets you started.

**Step 6:** Choose your investments. This is where most people get stuck, so do not overthink it. If you want the simplest option, pick a **Fidelity Freedom Index Fund** (a target-date fund based on your expected retirement year). If you are 25, pick the 2065 fund. If you are 22, pick the 2065 or 2070 fund. Done. We will cover more investment options later in this chapter.

**Step 7:** Confirm and submit. Your account is open. The first transfer from your bank usually takes 1-3 business days.

!!! tip "Fidelity's Best Feature for Beginners"
    Fidelity offers fractional shares, meaning you can buy a piece of an expensive stock or fund for as little as $1. You do not need thousands of dollars to start investing. They also have zero-expense-ratio index funds (FZROX for US stocks, FZILX for international), meaning you pay literally nothing in fund fees.

## Step-by-Step: Opening a Roth IRA at Vanguard

**Vanguard** is the other top recommendation. Vanguard is famous for pioneering low-cost index fund investing. It is owned by its fund shareholders (meaning you), so it has no outside owners trying to maximize profits at your expense.

**What you will need before you start:**

- Your Social Security number
- Your bank account and routing number
- Your employer's name and address
- A valid government ID
- About 15 minutes

**Step 1:** Go to [vanguard.com](https://www.vanguard.com) and click "Open an Account."

**Step 2:** Select "Roth IRA" as your account type.

**Step 3:** Enter your personal information, just like the Fidelity process: name, date of birth, Social Security number, address, and employment.

**Step 4:** Link your bank account by entering your routing and account numbers.

**Step 5:** Make your initial contribution. Vanguard's target-date funds have a $1,000 minimum investment. If you do not have $1,000 right away, you can invest in Vanguard ETFs (exchange-traded funds, which are like index funds that trade like stocks) with no minimum. A great starter option is VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF).

**Step 6:** Choose your investments. For simplicity, pick a **Vanguard Target Retirement Fund** matching your expected retirement year. If you are 25 years old, pick the Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund (VLXVX). This single fund gives you a diversified mix of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds that automatically adjusts as you age.

**Step 7:** Set up automatic investments. Vanguard lets you schedule automatic transfers from your bank account on a recurring basis. Set it and forget it.

**Step 8:** Confirm everything and submit. Welcome to your Roth IRA.

!!! note "Fidelity vs Vanguard: Which Should You Pick?"
    Both are excellent choices. You will not go wrong with either one. Fidelity has a slight edge for beginners because it has no minimums and a more modern website. Vanguard has a slight edge in philosophy (it is literally owned by its investors). Pick whichever feels more comfortable and open the account today. Do not let this decision become a reason to delay.

## What to Invest In: Investment Selection Inside Your IRA

Opening a Roth IRA is step one. Choosing your **investment selection** -- what you actually buy inside the account -- is step two. This is where many beginners stall out. They open the account, deposit money, and then leave it sitting as cash because they are not sure what to buy. Cash in a Roth IRA earns almost nothing. You need to invest it.

Here are your two best options, from simplest to slightly more involved.

### Option 1: Target Date Funds (Simplest)

A **target-date fund** is a single mutual fund that holds a mix of stocks and bonds and automatically adjusts over time. You pick the fund closest to the year you plan to retire, and the fund does everything else.

If you are 25 years old and plan to retire around age 65, that is about 2065. You would pick a 2065 target-date fund. When you are young, the fund holds mostly stocks (for growth). As you get closer to 2065, it gradually shifts toward bonds (for stability). This automatic adjustment is called a "glide path."

| Brokerage | Target-Date Fund Example | Expense Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Fidelity | Fidelity Freedom Index 2065 (FFIJX) | 0.12% |
| Vanguard | Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 (VLXVX) | 0.08% |

The expense ratio is the annual fee the fund charges, expressed as a percentage. An expense ratio of 0.08% means you pay 80 cents per year for every $1,000 invested. That is almost nothing.

Target-date funds are the "set it and forget it" option. If you want to invest without thinking about it, pick one and contribute automatically every month. You are done.

### Option 2: Three-Fund Portfolio (Slightly More Control)

A **three-fund portfolio** is a simple investment strategy that uses just three index funds to cover the entire global stock and bond market. It gives you slightly more control over your mix than a target-date fund, with only a tiny bit more effort.

The three funds are:

| Fund Type | What It Covers | Fidelity Option | Vanguard Option | Suggested Allocation (Age 20s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| US Total Stock Market | Every publicly traded US company | FSKAX (or FZROX, zero fee) | VTSAX (or VTI ETF) | 60% |
| International Stock Market | Companies outside the US | FTIHX (or FZILX, zero fee) | VTIAX (or VXUS ETF) | 30% |
| US Bond Market | US government and corporate bonds | FXNAX | VBTLX (or BND ETF) | 10% |

At your age, you want mostly stocks because you have decades for your investments to grow and recover from downturns. A split of 60% US stocks, 30% international stocks, and 10% bonds is a reasonable starting point. As you get older and closer to retirement, you gradually increase your bond percentage for stability.

The advantage of the three-fund portfolio over a target-date fund is lower costs (especially with Fidelity's zero-fee funds) and the ability to customize your allocation. The downside is that you need to rebalance once or twice a year -- check if your percentages have drifted and buy or sell to get back to your targets.

!!! tip "Cannot Decide? Start With the Target-Date Fund"
    If the three-fund portfolio feels overwhelming, go with the target-date fund. You can always switch later once you are more comfortable. The most important thing is to get your money invested, not to pick the perfect portfolio.

## Roth Conversion: Turning Traditional Money Into Roth Money

A **Roth conversion** is when you move money from a Traditional IRA (or a Traditional 401(k)) into a Roth IRA. You pay income taxes on the converted amount in the year you do it, but after that, the money grows tax-free in your Roth forever.

Why would someone do this? A few common scenarios:

- You have an old Traditional IRA or a 401(k) from a previous employer and want to move it into a Roth for tax-free growth going forward.
- You are in a year with unusually low income (maybe you went back to school or took time off), so your tax rate is temporarily low. Converting during a low-income year means paying less tax on the conversion.
- You want to avoid required minimum distributions later in life (Traditional accounts force you to start withdrawing at age 73; Roth accounts never do).

The catch: you owe income taxes on the full converted amount in the year you convert. If you convert $20,000 from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, that $20,000 is added to your taxable income for the year. Make sure you have money outside the IRA to pay the tax bill. Do not pay the taxes from the converted amount itself -- that defeats the purpose.

For most young adults just starting out, a Roth conversion is not immediately relevant. You should be contributing directly to a Roth IRA. But it is a powerful tool to know about for the future, especially if your income eventually exceeds the Roth IRA income limits and you need to use the "backdoor Roth" strategy (contributing to a Traditional IRA and then immediately converting to Roth).

## Required Distributions: Why Roth IRAs Win Again

**Required minimum distributions (RMDs)** are mandatory withdrawals the IRS forces you to take from certain retirement accounts starting at age 73. Traditional IRAs and Traditional 401(k)s have RMDs. The government gave you a tax break when you put the money in, and they want their taxes eventually.

Here is the problem with RMDs: you might not need or want the money at 73. Maybe your expenses are low in retirement. Maybe you want to leave the money to your kids. Too bad -- the IRS says you have to pull it out and pay taxes on it, whether you need it or not. And if you do not take your RMD, the penalty is steep: 25% of the amount you should have withdrawn.

**Roth IRAs have no RMDs.** You never have to withdraw if you do not want to. Your money can keep growing tax-free for your entire life and even be passed to your heirs tax-free. This is another major reason the Roth IRA is so valuable for young investors with decades of potential growth ahead.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Now that you understand how the Roth IRA fits into the bigger picture, here is your order of operations. Follow these in sequence:

1. **Build $1,000 starter emergency fund** -- Your financial foundation. Nothing else happens until this is done.
2. **Get your full employer 401(k) match** -- Free money from your employer. We cover this in Chapter 11.
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** -- Credit cards, payday loans, personal loans. Covered in Chapter 6.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses** -- Full financial safety net. Covered in Chapter 5.
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** -- This is what this chapter is about. Open one TODAY if you have reached this step.
6. **Invest in low-cost index funds** -- Beyond your Roth IRA, use a taxable brokerage account. Covered in Chapters 8-9.
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** -- Car loans, some student loans.
8. **Save for specific goals** -- House down payment, wedding, travel.

If you are at Priority #5 and have the ability to contribute, every month you delay opening your Roth IRA is money left on the table. The age 22 vs 32 comparison above proves it: time is the most valuable thing you have. Do not waste it.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: "I'll open a Roth IRA when I make more money."** This is the most expensive mistake on this list. Every year you delay costs you real money. Even $50 per month is better than $0 per month. A 22-year-old putting in $50/month earns more by age 65 than a 32-year-old putting in $100/month. Start now with whatever you can.

**Mistake #2: Opening the account but not investing the money.** Depositing money into a Roth IRA does not automatically invest it. If you skip the investment selection step, your money sits as cash earning nearly nothing. After you deposit money, you must buy an investment (a target-date fund or index funds). Check your account -- if it says "cash" or "core position," your money is not invested.

**Mistake #3: Trying to pick individual stocks.** Your Roth IRA is not a place to gamble on the next big stock. It is a long-term retirement account. Put it in broadly diversified index funds and let compound growth do the work. Stock-picking is fun in theory but loses to index funds the vast majority of the time.

**Mistake #4: Withdrawing early.** You can withdraw your contributions (the money you put in) at any time without penalty. But withdrawing the growth before age 59.5 triggers taxes and a 10% penalty. Treat your Roth IRA as untouchable until retirement. That said, knowing you can access your contributions in a true emergency provides peace of mind.

**Mistake #5: Not knowing about income limits.** In 2025, you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if your modified adjusted gross income is above $150,000 (single) or $236,000 (married filing jointly). If you are approaching these limits, look into the "backdoor Roth" strategy. For most young adults starting out, this is not an issue yet.

**Mistake #6: Paying high fees.** Some brokerages and financial advisors charge high fees that eat into your returns. Stick with Fidelity or Vanguard. Use index funds with expense ratios below 0.20%. Never pay a "load" (an upfront sales commission) on a mutual fund.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of Roth IRAs and retirement accounts.

??? question "1. What is the main difference between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA?"
    **Roth IRA: pay taxes now, withdraw tax-free later. Traditional IRA: get a tax break now, pay taxes when you withdraw.** For most young adults, the Roth is better because you are likely in a lower tax bracket now than you will be in retirement.

??? question "2. What is the Roth IRA contribution limit for 2025 (under age 50)?"
    **$7,000 per year.** This is the combined limit across all your IRAs. You can contribute up to $7,000 total between Roth and Traditional IRAs, not $7,000 to each.

??? question "3. Alex starts investing $7,000/year at age 22. Jordan starts at age 32. Both earn 10% average returns and retire at 65. Approximately how much more does Alex have?"
    **About $2 million more.** Alex ends up with roughly $3.2 million while Jordan ends up with roughly $1.2 million. Alex contributed only $70,000 more but ends up with $2 million more because of compound growth over the extra ten years.

??? question "4. You deposit $7,000 into your Roth IRA but do not select any investments. What happens?"
    **Your money sits as cash, earning almost nothing.** Depositing money into a Roth IRA does not automatically invest it. You must choose an investment (like a target-date fund or index funds) after making your deposit.

??? question "5. What is a target-date fund?"
    **A single fund that holds a mix of stocks and bonds and automatically adjusts over time based on your expected retirement year.** If you plan to retire around 2065, you pick a 2065 target-date fund. It starts stock-heavy for growth and gradually shifts to bonds for stability as you approach retirement.

??? question "6. What are required minimum distributions (RMDs), and do they apply to Roth IRAs?"
    **RMDs are mandatory withdrawals the IRS requires from Traditional retirement accounts starting at age 73. Roth IRAs do NOT have RMDs.** You never have to withdraw from a Roth IRA if you do not want to, which means your money can keep growing tax-free indefinitely.

## Key Terms

- **Roth IRA**: A retirement investment account where you contribute after-tax money, your investments grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. Named after Senator William Roth, who helped create it in 1997.

- **Traditional IRA**: A retirement account where contributions may be tax-deductible (reducing your taxes today), but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Growth is tax-deferred, not tax-free.

- **IRA Contribution Limits**: The maximum amount the IRS allows you to contribute to your IRAs each year. For 2025, the limit is $7,000 per year (under age 50) or $8,000 (age 50 and older). This is a combined limit across all your IRAs.

- **Tax-Free Growth**: Investment growth that is never taxed -- not when it happens, not when you withdraw it. This is the key benefit of a Roth IRA. Your contributions and all their growth come out tax-free in retirement.

- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Investment growth that is not taxed now but will be taxed when you withdraw it in retirement. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s use this model. "Deferred" means postponed, not eliminated.

- **Required Distributions (RMDs)**: Mandatory minimum withdrawals the IRS requires you to take from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s starting at age 73. Failure to take your RMD results in a 25% penalty on the amount you should have withdrawn. Roth IRAs have no RMDs.

- **Roth Conversion**: The process of moving money from a Traditional IRA or 401(k) into a Roth IRA. You pay income taxes on the converted amount in the year of conversion, but the money then grows tax-free in the Roth going forward.

- **Investment Selection**: The specific funds or securities you choose to buy inside your IRA. Simply depositing money is not enough -- you must actively invest it in stocks, bonds, or funds for it to grow.

- **Target Date Fund**: A single mutual fund that holds a diversified mix of stocks and bonds and automatically adjusts its allocation over time based on a target retirement year. It becomes more conservative (more bonds, fewer stocks) as the target date approaches.

- **Three-Fund Portfolio**: An investment strategy using just three index funds (US total stock market, international stock market, and US bond market) to achieve broad diversification at very low cost. A popular approach for DIY investors who want simplicity with some control.

- **Fidelity**: One of the largest investment brokerages in the US. Known for no-minimum accounts, zero-expense-ratio index funds, fractional shares, and a user-friendly platform. An excellent choice for opening a Roth IRA.

- **Vanguard**: The investment company that pioneered low-cost index fund investing. Uniquely structured so that it is owned by its fund shareholders. Known for very low expense ratios and a long-term investing philosophy. Another excellent choice for opening a Roth IRA.

## What To Do This Week

Here is your action plan. If you have completed Priorities #1 through #4, do these steps this week. If not, bookmark this page and come back when you are ready.

- [ ] **Day 1**: Decide between Fidelity and Vanguard. Read the step-by-step instructions above for each one. Pick whichever appeals to you more. Either is a great choice -- do not let this decision take more than 10 minutes.
- [ ] **Day 2**: Open your Roth IRA. Follow the step-by-step guide above. Gather your Social Security number, bank account info, and ID. The process takes about 15 minutes.
- [ ] **Day 3**: Make your first contribution. Even if it is $100. Transfer money from your checking account into your new Roth IRA. Remember, you can contribute up to $7,000 for the 2025 tax year.
- [ ] **Day 4**: Invest your contribution. Do not leave it as cash. Pick a target-date fund matching your expected retirement year (2060 or 2065 for most readers). Buy it. You are now invested.
- [ ] **Day 5**: Set up automatic monthly contributions. Even $100/month ($1,200/year) puts you ahead of most Americans. Pick a date right after payday and automate the transfer and investment.
- [ ] **Weekend**: Run the numbers yourself. Use the Roth IRA Growth Calculator MicroSim above. Enter your age, your planned monthly contribution, and see what your account could look like at 65. Then try adding 10 years to your starting age and see what you lose. Let those numbers motivate you.

Every month you wait to open your Roth IRA costs you money you will never get back. The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is right now.
