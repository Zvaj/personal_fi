# Chapter 6: Debt Elimination Strategies

## Summary

This chapter gives you a concrete plan to eliminate debt using two proven methods: the snowball method (smallest balance first for motivation) and the avalanche method (highest interest first for math). You'll learn the difference between good and bad debt, understand student loan repayment options, and know when refinancing or consolidation makes sense. Real examples show you exactly how much faster you can be debt-free.

## Introduction: Debt Is Not a Life Sentence

If you are carrying debt right now, you are not alone. The average American under 30 has roughly $21,000 in debt (not counting mortgages). Student loans, credit cards, car payments -- it can feel like you will be paying these off forever.

Here is the truth: you will not. Debt is a math problem, and math problems have solutions. By the end of this chapter, you will have a specific plan -- with real numbers and a real timeline -- to eliminate your debt and stay out of it for good.

But first, you need to understand how debt actually works. Not the vague "debt is bad" advice you have heard a hundred times. The actual mechanics: how interest is calculated, why minimum payments keep you trapped, and which debts to attack first. Once you see the math, the path forward becomes clear.

!!! tip "Where This Fits in the Priority Framework"
    Paying off high-interest debt (anything above 7%) is **Priority #3** in your financial plan -- right after building your $1,000 starter emergency fund (Priority #1) and getting your full employer 401(k) match (Priority #2). If you are carrying credit card debt at 20%+ interest, this chapter is your battle plan.

## How Interest Works: The Engine Behind Every Debt

Before you can fight debt effectively, you need to understand the weapon it uses against you: interest. An **interest rate** is the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the amount you owe. When you borrow $10,000 at a 6% interest rate, you pay the lender an extra 6% per year on top of repaying the original $10,000.

Think of interest as rent you pay for using someone else's money. The higher the interest rate, the more expensive the rent. And just like actual rent, you pay it every single month whether you like it or not.

### Simple Interest

**Simple interest** is the straightforward version. You pay interest only on the original amount you borrowed (called the principal). Most car loans and some personal loans use simple interest.

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

For example, if you borrow $8,000 for a car at 6.5% simple interest for 4 years:

\[
\text{Interest} = \$8{,}000 \times 0.065 \times 4 = \$2{,}080
\]

You would pay $2,080 in interest over the life of the loan. The total cost of the car loan is $10,080, and your monthly payment would be about $210.

### Compound Interest

**Compound interest** is where things get dangerous. With compound interest, you pay interest on your original balance AND on the interest that has already been added to your balance. It is interest on top of interest. Credit cards and most student loans use compound interest.

Here is a simple way to think about it: with simple interest, the interest charge stays the same each period. With compound interest, the interest charge grows because your balance grows.

\[
\text{Total with Compound Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{n \times t}
\]

Where \( r \) is the annual rate, \( n \) is how many times per year interest compounds, and \( t \) is the number of years.

If you owe $5,000 on a credit card at 22% interest compounded monthly and make no payments:

- After 1 year: $6,228
- After 3 years: $9,667
- After 5 years: $15,027

Your $5,000 debt nearly triples in five years without a single new purchase. This is compound interest working against you.

!!! warning "Compound Interest: Your Best Friend or Worst Enemy"
    Compound interest is the same force that makes investments grow over decades (covered in Chapter 8). The difference is direction. When you invest, compound interest works FOR you. When you carry debt, it works AGAINST you. The math is identical -- the only question is which side of the equation you are on.

### Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

The **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** is the total yearly cost of borrowing, including the interest rate plus any fees the lender charges. It is the number you should actually compare when shopping for loans, because it gives you the true cost. A loan might advertise a 5% interest rate but have an APR of 5.8% once you include origination fees.

For credit cards, the APR and the interest rate are usually the same number because credit cards do not typically charge upfront fees baked into the rate. When your credit card says "22.99% APR," that is the annual interest rate applied to any balance you carry past the due date.

---

## What Is Debt, Really?

**Debt** is money you owe to someone else. That is it. Every time you borrow money -- whether from a bank, a credit card company, the federal government, or your uncle -- you have debt. The amount you originally borrowed is called the principal, and the cost of borrowing is the interest.

Not all debt is created equal. Some debt can actually help you build wealth over time, while other debt drains your bank account and gives you nothing in return. Understanding this distinction is critical to making smart financial decisions.

### Good Debt vs Bad Debt

**Good debt** is borrowing that has the potential to increase your net worth or earning power over time. **Bad debt** is borrowing that loses value or funds consumption you cannot afford.

| Type | Examples | Typical Interest Rate | Why It Is Good or Bad |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Good Debt** | Federal student loans (for in-demand degree) | 5-7% | Increases your earning potential over a lifetime |
| **Good Debt** | Mortgage (primary residence) | 6-7% | Builds equity in an asset that typically appreciates |
| **Good Debt** | Small business loan | 7-10% | Creates income-generating potential |
| **Bad Debt** | Credit card balances carried month to month | 18-28% | Funds consumption that loses value immediately |
| **Bad Debt** | Payday loans | 300-600% | Predatory rates that trap borrowers in cycles |
| **Bad Debt** | Financing a luxury car you cannot afford | 8-15% | Depreciating asset with high payments |
| **Gray Area** | Car loan (reliable, affordable vehicle) | 5-8% | Necessary but depreciates; keep it reasonable |
| **Gray Area** | Student loans for a low-paying field | 5-7% | Education is good, but ROI matters |

Here is the key insight: even "good" debt is still debt. A $200,000 mortgage is better than $200,000 in credit card debt, but you are still on the hook for the payments. The goal is to use good debt strategically and eliminate bad debt as fast as possible.

!!! note "The Gray Area Is Real"
    A car loan can be smart debt (you need reliable transportation to get to work) or terrible debt (you financed a $45,000 truck on a $35,000 salary). Context matters. The question is always: does this borrowing move my financial life forward or backward?

---

## The Minimum Payment Trap

Every debt you carry has a **minimum payment** -- the smallest amount you must pay each month to avoid penalties and keep the account in good standing. Credit card companies love to set this number very low, usually 1-3% of your balance or $25, whichever is greater.

This is the **minimum payment trap**: making only the minimum payment keeps you in good standing, but you barely put a dent in the actual balance. Most of your payment goes toward interest, not principal. The result? A debt that should take a few years to pay off stretches into decades.

#### Diagram: The Minimum Payment Trap in Action

<details><summary>$5,000 Credit Card at 22% APR -- Minimum Payments Only</summary>

```
Balance: $5,000 | APR: 22% | Minimum Payment: 2% of balance or $25

Year 1:  $5,000 ████████████████████████████████████████
         Paid: $1,103  → Interest: $1,013  → Principal: $90
         Remaining: $4,910

Year 3:  $4,910 ███████████████████████████████████████
         After 3 years of minimums, balance barely drops
         Total paid so far: ~$3,100 | Balance still: ~$4,580

Year 5:  $4,580 █████████████████████████████████████
         Total paid so far: ~$4,900 | Balance still: ~$4,100

Year 10: $3,200 █████████████████████████
         Total paid so far: ~$8,500 | Balance still: ~$3,200

Year 15: $1,900 ███████████████
         Total paid so far: ~$11,200 | Balance still: ~$1,900

Year 20: $700   █████
         Total paid so far: ~$13,000 | Balance still: ~$700

Year 24: $0
         FINALLY PAID OFF

Total paid: ~$13,600 on a $5,000 balance
Interest paid: ~$8,600 — you paid the debt ALMOST THREE TIMES OVER
Time to payoff: ~24 years
```

</details>

Read those numbers again. You borrowed $5,000 and paid back $13,600. You paid $8,600 in interest alone. And it took 24 years. That is the minimum payment trap. The credit card company is thrilled. You should be furious.

Now compare: if you paid a fixed $200 per month instead of just the minimum, you would pay off the same $5,000 in about 32 months and pay roughly $1,900 in interest. Same debt, same interest rate -- $6,700 less in interest and 21 fewer years of payments. That is the power of paying more than the minimum.

---

## Two Proven Strategies: Snowball vs Avalanche

Now that you understand how interest and minimum payments work, let us talk strategy. When you have multiple debts, which one do you attack first? There are two proven methods, and they each have a real advantage.

### The Debt Snowball Method

The **Debt Snowball Method** means you pay off your debts in order from smallest balance to largest balance, regardless of interest rate. You make minimum payments on everything except the smallest debt, and throw every extra dollar at that one until it is gone. Then you take that entire payment and roll it into the next smallest debt.

**Why it works:** You get quick wins. Paying off a $500 balance feels amazing and gives you momentum to keep going. Behavioral research shows that people who use the snowball method are more likely to stick with their debt payoff plan because of those early victories.

**The downside:** You might pay more total interest because you are not prioritizing the highest-rate debt first.

### The Debt Avalanche Method

The **Debt Avalanche Method** means you pay off your debts in order from highest interest rate to lowest interest rate, regardless of balance. You make minimum payments on everything except the highest-rate debt, and throw every extra dollar at that one first.

**Why it works:** Pure math. By attacking the most expensive debt first, you minimize the total interest you pay over the life of your debt. This method saves you the most money.

**The downside:** If your highest-rate debt also has a large balance, it can take a long time to see your first debt disappear. Some people lose motivation.

### Which One Should You Pick?

Here is the honest answer: the best method is the one you will actually stick with. If you need motivation and quick wins, use the snowball. If you are disciplined and the math matters more to you than the psychology, use the avalanche.

In many cases, the difference in total interest between the two methods is smaller than people expect, especially if your debts are similar in size. Picking either one and committing to it is far better than not having a plan at all.

## Real-World Example: Meet Jordan

Jordan is 26 years old with three debts and $800 per month to throw at debt repayment (after covering all other expenses and the $1,000 starter emergency fund):

| Debt | Balance | Interest Rate (APR) | Minimum Payment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credit card | $5,000 | 22.0% | $125 |
| Car loan | $8,000 | 6.5% | $185 |
| Student loans | $25,000 | 5.5% | $280 |
| **Total** | **$38,000** | -- | **$590** |

Jordan has $800/month for debt payments. After covering the $590 in minimum payments, that leaves $210 extra per month to target one debt aggressively.

### Snowball Approach (Smallest Balance First)

**Order:** Credit card ($5,000) → Car loan ($8,000) → Student loans ($25,000)

1. **Months 1-16:** Pay $335/month toward credit card ($125 min + $210 extra). Minimums on everything else. Credit card paid off in about 16 months. Interest paid on credit card: ~$1,050.
2. **Months 17-33:** Roll the $335 into the car loan. Now paying $520/month toward the car ($185 min + $335 freed up). Car loan paid off in about 17 more months. Interest paid on car loan: ~$1,550.
3. **Months 34-65:** Roll everything into student loans. Now paying $800/month toward student loans. Paid off in about 32 more months. Interest paid on student loans: ~$5,800.

**Total timeline: ~65 months (5 years, 5 months)**
**Total interest paid: ~$8,400**

### Avalanche Approach (Highest Interest Rate First)

**Order:** Credit card (22%) → Car loan (6.5%) → Student loans (5.5%)

In this case, the snowball and avalanche give the same order because the smallest balance also has the highest interest rate. That is a lucky coincidence. Let us adjust the example slightly to see a real difference. Suppose Jordan's debts looked like this instead:

| Debt | Balance | Interest Rate (APR) | Minimum Payment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credit card | $5,000 | 22.0% | $125 |
| Student loans | $25,000 | 5.5% | $280 |
| Car loan | $8,000 | 6.5% | $185 |

**Snowball order (smallest balance first):** Credit card → Car loan → Student loans
**Avalanche order (highest rate first):** Credit card → Car loan → Student loans

Even here, the order is the same for both methods because the credit card is both the smallest balance and the highest rate, and the car loan has a higher rate than the student loans. Let us show a scenario where they differ. Imagine the car loan was $3,000 instead:

| Debt (Modified Scenario) | Balance | APR | Minimum Payment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Car loan | $3,000 | 6.5% | $100 |
| Credit card | $5,000 | 22.0% | $125 |
| Student loans | $25,000 | 5.5% | $280 |

- **Snowball:** Car loan ($3,000) → Credit card ($5,000) → Student loans ($25,000)
- **Avalanche:** Credit card ($5,000) → Car loan ($3,000) → Student loans ($25,000)

| Method | Total Interest Paid | Months to Debt-Free |
|---|---|---|
| Snowball (smallest first) | ~$8,900 | ~63 months |
| Avalanche (highest rate first) | ~$7,800 | ~61 months |
| **Avalanche advantage** | **~$1,100 saved** | **~2 months faster** |

The avalanche saves Jordan about $1,100 and two months. But the snowball gives Jordan a paid-off car loan in roughly 8 months -- an early win that can feel incredibly motivating.

## Student Loans: A Special Category

**Student loans** are money borrowed to pay for college or graduate school. They come in two main flavors: federal (from the U.S. government) and private (from banks and other lenders). This distinction matters enormously because federal loans come with protections and repayment options that private loans do not.

If you have student loans, understanding your repayment options is not optional. Picking the wrong plan can cost you thousands.

### Federal Student Loan Repayment Plans

| Plan | Monthly Payment | Timeline | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard Repayment** | Fixed, ~$280/month per $25,000 borrowed | 10 years | People who can afford it (least total interest) |
| **Graduated Repayment** | Starts low, increases every 2 years | 10 years | Early-career earners expecting salary growth |
| **Extended Repayment** | Lower fixed or graduated payments | Up to 25 years | People who need lower payments (more total interest) |
| **SAVE Plan (income-driven)** | 5-10% of discretionary income | 20-25 years | Lower earners; potential loan forgiveness after 20-25 years |
| **PAYE (income-driven)** | 10% of discretionary income | 20 years | Borrowers with high debt relative to income |
| **IBR (income-driven)** | 10-15% of discretionary income | 20-25 years | Borrowers who do not qualify for SAVE or PAYE |

!!! note "Income-Driven Repayment: The Trade-Off"
    Income-driven plans lower your monthly payment, which can be a lifesaver if your income is low. But because the payments are smaller, you pay more interest over the life of the loan. The trade-off is often worth it if you qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) or if your income will rise significantly over time.

### What About Private Student Loans?

Private student loans have none of these flexible repayment options. Your rate is set by the lender, your repayment terms are fixed, and there is no forgiveness program. If you have both federal and private student loans, keep them separate and never consolidate federal loans into a private loan -- you would lose all federal protections.

---

## Loan Refinancing

**Loan refinancing** means taking out a new loan with better terms (usually a lower interest rate) to replace an existing loan. You use the new loan to pay off the old one, and then you make payments on the new loan instead.

Refinancing makes sense when:

- Your credit score has improved since you originally borrowed
- Interest rates in the market have dropped
- You want to change your repayment timeline (shorter for less interest, longer for lower payments)

Refinancing does NOT make sense when:

- You are refinancing federal student loans into a private loan (you lose income-driven repayment options and forgiveness eligibility)
- The fees on the new loan eat up the interest savings
- You extend the term so much that you end up paying more total interest even with a lower rate

**Example:** Jordan's car loan is $8,000 at 6.5%. If Jordan's credit score has improved, a bank might offer to refinance at 4.5%. On the remaining balance, that could save $300-$500 in interest over the life of the loan.

---

## Debt Consolidation

**Debt consolidation** means combining multiple debts into a single new loan, usually with a lower interest rate or a simpler payment structure. Instead of juggling three payments to three lenders, you make one payment to one lender.

Common consolidation methods:

- **Balance transfer credit card:** Move high-interest credit card debt to a new card offering 0% APR for 12-18 months. You must pay off the balance before the promotional period ends, or the rate jumps (often to 22%+).
- **Personal consolidation loan:** A fixed-rate loan from a bank or online lender used to pay off multiple debts. Typical rates: 6-15% depending on your credit.
- **Federal Direct Consolidation Loan:** Combines multiple federal student loans into one. Does not lower your rate (it averages them), but simplifies payments and can make you eligible for certain repayment plans.

!!! warning "Consolidation Is Not a Magic Fix"
    Consolidation simplifies your payments and might lower your interest rate, but it does not reduce the amount you owe. The real danger is this: people consolidate their credit card debt, feel relieved, and then start charging up the cards again. Now they have the consolidation loan AND new credit card debt. If you consolidate, cut up the cards or lock them away.

---

## Your Debt-to-Income Ratio

Your **debt-to-income ratio (DTI)** is the percentage of your gross monthly income (before taxes) that goes toward debt payments. Lenders use this number to decide whether to approve you for new borrowing like a mortgage or car loan.

\[
\text{DTI} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly Debt Payments}}{\text{Gross Monthly Income}} \times 100
\]

**Example:** Jordan earns $4,500/month gross and pays $590/month in minimum debt payments.

\[
\text{DTI} = \frac{\$590}{\$4{,}500} \times 100 = 13.1\%
\]

| DTI Range | What It Means |
|---|---|
| Under 20% | Excellent. Lenders love you. |
| 20-35% | Manageable. Most lenders will still approve you. |
| 36-43% | Getting tight. Harder to qualify for a mortgage. |
| 43-50% | Risky. Most lenders will decline or charge high rates. |
| Over 50% | Crisis zone. You need a serious debt payoff plan immediately. |

Your DTI is one more reason to aggressively pay down debt. Every loan you eliminate lowers your DTI, which opens doors for future financial moves like buying a home.

---

## Building Your Payoff Timeline

A **payoff timeline** is your personalized schedule showing when each debt will be paid off and when you will be completely debt-free. Having a concrete date turns "I'm drowning in debt" into "I will be debt-free by March 2029." That shift in mindset is powerful.

### Step-by-Step: Create Your Debt Payoff Plan

**Step 1: List every debt.** Write down each debt, its balance, interest rate (APR), and minimum payment. Use the table format from Jordan's example above.

**Step 2: Find your extra money.** Look at your budget (Chapter 2). After covering essentials and your $1,000 emergency fund, how much extra can you put toward debt each month? Even $50 matters.

**Step 3: Choose your method.** Snowball (smallest balance first) or avalanche (highest interest rate first). Pick one and commit.

**Step 4: Build the timeline.**

- List your debts in order according to your chosen method
- Calculate how many months to pay off debt #1 (balance divided by minimum + extra payments, adjusting for interest)
- When debt #1 is done, add its payment to debt #2 (this is the "snowball" rolling downhill)
- Repeat until all debts show a payoff date

**Step 5: Write down your debt-free date.** Put it on your phone, your bathroom mirror, your desktop wallpaper. This date is your motivation.

**Step 6: Revisit monthly.** Track your progress. As balances drop, your motivation grows. If your income increases, throw the extra at your debt.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Here is the complete priority framework, with this chapter's focus highlighted:

1. **Build $1,000 starter emergency fund** -- Done? Good. If not, do this first. (Chapter 5)
2. **Get full employer 401(k) match** -- Free money. Do not leave it on the table. (Chapter 11)
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** -- **THIS IS WHERE YOU ARE.** Credit cards, payday loans, high-rate personal loans. Use the snowball or avalanche method from this chapter.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months expenses** -- Come back and finish your safety net. (Chapter 5)
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** -- Tax-free growth for retirement. (Chapter 10)
6. **Invest additional money in low-cost index funds** -- Build long-term wealth. (Chapters 8-9)
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** -- Car loans, student loans. These are less urgent but still worth eliminating.
8. **Save for specific goals (house, car, travel)** -- Once the high-priority items are handled.

Notice that high-interest debt (Priority #3) comes before finishing your emergency fund (Priority #4). That is because credit card interest at 22% costs you far more than the 4-5% your HYSA earns. The math says: get your $1,000 cushion, then go to war with expensive debt.

Medium-interest debt (Priority #7) is lower on the list because rates of 4-7% are close to what your investments might earn. At that level, it becomes a judgment call -- but eliminating those payments frees up cash flow and feels great.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake #1: Paying off debt with no emergency fund.** If you throw every dollar at debt and then your car breaks down, the repair goes right back on a credit card. Keep that $1,000 starter fund in place. Always.

**Mistake #2: Not knowing your interest rates.** If you do not know the APR on every debt you carry, you cannot make an informed plan. Log into each account and write down the number today.

**Mistake #3: Closing credit cards after paying them off.** Paying off a credit card is great. Closing the account hurts your credit score by reducing your available credit and shortening your credit history. Pay it off, cut up the card if you need to, but keep the account open.

**Mistake #4: Consolidating federal student loans into a private loan.** You lose access to income-driven repayment, PSLF, and all other federal protections. This is almost never worth a slightly lower interest rate.

**Mistake #5: Only making minimum payments.** As you saw in the minimum payment trap section, minimums keep you in debt for decades. Pay as far above the minimum as you possibly can on your target debt.

**Mistake #6: Taking on new debt while paying off old debt.** Financing a new couch while you still have $5,000 in credit card debt is like bailing water out of a boat while drilling new holes in the hull. Stop borrowing until your high-interest debt is gone.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of debt elimination strategies.

??? question "1. You have $3,000 in credit card debt at 24% APR and $15,000 in student loans at 5%. Which do you pay off first using the avalanche method?"
    **The credit card.** The avalanche method targets the highest interest rate first. At 24% APR, the credit card costs you far more per dollar borrowed than the 5% student loans. Every extra dollar should go to the credit card while you make minimum payments on the student loans.

??? question "2. Why is making only the minimum payment on a credit card so expensive?"
    **Because most of the minimum payment goes to interest, not principal.** On a $5,000 balance at 22% APR, minimum payments stretch repayment to roughly 24 years and cost about $8,600 in interest -- nearly three times the original balance. Paying even $50-$100 above the minimum dramatically reduces both the timeline and total cost.

??? question "3. Your friend says 'All debt is bad debt.' Are they right?"
    **Not exactly.** While all debt carries cost and risk, some borrowing can increase your earning power or net worth over time. Federal student loans for an in-demand degree or a mortgage on a reasonably priced home are examples of debt that can move your finances forward. The key is the interest rate, the purpose, and whether the borrowing creates long-term value.

??? question "4. You have $20,000 in federal student loans and are offered a private refinance at a lower rate. Should you take it?"
    **Probably not.** Refinancing federal student loans into a private loan means you lose access to income-driven repayment plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and other federal protections. Those safety nets are often worth more than the interest savings, especially early in your career when your income might be uncertain.

??? question "5. What is a good debt-to-income ratio to aim for?"
    **Under 20% is excellent, and under 36% is manageable.** Once your DTI exceeds 43%, most mortgage lenders will decline your application. Paying off debt directly lowers your DTI, which opens up better borrowing options in the future.

## Key Terms

!!! abstract "Glossary"

    - **Debt**: Money you owe to another person or institution, including the original amount borrowed (principal) plus interest.

    - **Good Debt vs Bad Debt**: Good debt has the potential to increase your net worth or earning power (student loans, mortgage). Bad debt funds consumption and loses value immediately (credit card balances, payday loans).

    - **Interest Rate**: The cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the amount owed. A 6% interest rate means you pay $6 per year for every $100 borrowed.

    - **Simple Interest**: Interest calculated only on the original principal. The interest charge stays the same each period.

    - **Compound Interest**: Interest calculated on both the original principal and accumulated interest. Interest charges grow over time because the balance grows.

    - **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: The total yearly cost of borrowing, including interest rate plus fees, expressed as a percentage. Use APR to compare the true cost of different loans.

    - **Minimum Payment Trap**: The cycle of making only the minimum required payment on a debt, which causes repayment to stretch across decades and costs many times the original balance in interest.

    - **Debt Snowball Method**: A repayment strategy that pays off debts from smallest balance to largest, regardless of interest rate. Provides psychological wins and momentum.

    - **Debt Avalanche Method**: A repayment strategy that pays off debts from highest interest rate to lowest, regardless of balance. Saves the most money in total interest.

    - **Student Loans**: Money borrowed to pay for higher education, available as federal loans (from the government, with flexible repayment and forgiveness options) or private loans (from banks, with fixed terms and no forgiveness).

    - **Loan Refinancing**: Replacing an existing loan with a new loan that has better terms, typically a lower interest rate. Useful when your credit improves or market rates drop.

    - **Debt Consolidation**: Combining multiple debts into a single loan, simplifying payments and potentially lowering the interest rate. Does not reduce the total amount owed.

    - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: The percentage of your gross monthly income that goes toward debt payments. Lenders use this to assess your borrowing capacity. Under 20% is excellent; over 43% is a red flag.

    - **Payoff Timeline**: A personalized schedule showing when each debt will be eliminated and when you will be completely debt-free. Having a concrete date transforms debt from overwhelming to manageable.

## What To Do This Week

Here is your action plan. Do these in order.

- [ ] **Day 1:** List every debt you owe. Write down the name, balance, APR, and minimum payment. Check your loan servicer websites and credit card statements for the exact numbers.
- [ ] **Day 2:** Calculate your debt-to-income ratio. Divide your total monthly minimum payments by your gross monthly income. Write down the percentage.
- [ ] **Day 3:** Choose your method -- snowball or avalanche. Order your debts accordingly. If you want quick wins, go snowball. If you want to save the most money, go avalanche. Either one works.
- [ ] **Day 4:** Find extra money in your budget. Review your spending from Chapter 2 and identify at least $50-$100 per month you can redirect toward your target debt. Cancel a subscription, reduce dining out, sell something you do not use.
- [ ] **Day 5:** Set up the payments. Automate minimum payments on all debts (so you never miss one), then set up the extra payment toward your target debt.
- [ ] **Weekend:** Calculate your debt-free date. Use the MicroSim above or a free online calculator like undebt.it. Write the date somewhere you will see it every day. That is your finish line.

Debt is not permanent. It is a problem with a solution, and now you have the strategy to solve it. Every extra dollar you throw at your debt today is a dollar that is not being eaten alive by interest tomorrow. Start this week.
