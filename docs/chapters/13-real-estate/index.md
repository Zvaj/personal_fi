## Introduction: Housing Is Your Biggest Expense

For most people, housing is the single largest line item in their budget. Whether you rent or buy, you will likely spend 25-35% of your take-home pay on putting a roof over your head. That makes this one of the most important financial decisions you will face in your twenties and thirties.

Here is the thing nobody tells you: buying a home is not always the smart financial move. Social media, your parents, and even some financial advisors will tell you that renting is "throwing money away." That is an oversimplification that has led many young adults to buy homes they could not afford, in cities they did not plan to stay in, with money they did not have.

The truth is more nuanced. Sometimes buying is a wealth-building powerhouse. Sometimes renting gives you flexibility and financial freedom that homeownership cannot match. This chapter gives you the real numbers so you can decide for yourself.

!!! tip "Where Does Buying a Home Fit in Your Priorities?"
    A home purchase is Priority #8 in your financial plan -- "Save for specific goals." Before saving for a down payment, make sure you have: (1) your $1,000 starter emergency fund, (2) your full employer 401(k) match, (3) high-interest debt above 7% paid off, (4) your emergency fund built to 3-6 months, (5) your Roth IRA maxed out, and (6) low-cost index fund investing underway. A house is a major goal, but it should not come at the expense of your financial foundation.

## What Is Real Estate?

**Real estate** means land and any buildings or structures permanently attached to it. When people talk about "investing in real estate," they usually mean buying property -- a house, a condo, an apartment building, or even vacant land -- with the expectation that it will grow in value over time or generate rental income.

For most young adults, the real estate question boils down to one thing: should I keep renting, or should I buy a place to live? That is what this chapter focuses on. We are not talking about becoming a real estate mogul or flipping houses. We are talking about the practical decision of where you live and how you pay for it.

Real estate is unique among financial decisions because it is both an investment and a living expense. Your home can build wealth over time, but it also costs money to maintain, insure, and pay taxes on. Understanding both sides of this equation is critical to making a smart choice.

## Renting vs. Buying: The Honest Comparison

Let us cut through the noise and look at what renting and buying actually cost, using real numbers.

**The renting scenario:** You pay $1,500 per month in rent for a one-bedroom apartment. Your landlord handles maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. If the water heater breaks, you call the landlord. If you get a job offer in another city, you finish your lease and move.

**The buying scenario:** You buy a $300,000 home with 5% down ($15,000). You take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.8% interest. Your monthly mortgage payment is about $1,761 for principal and interest alone. But that is not your total cost.

Here is what homeownership actually costs each month on that $300,000 home:

| Monthly Cost | Renting | Buying ($300K Home, 5% Down) |
|---|---|---|
| Base payment | $1,500 (rent) | $1,761 (principal + interest) |
| Property taxes | $0 (included in rent) | $313 ($3,750/year) |
| Homeowner's insurance | $0 (renter's insurance ~$15) | $150 ($1,800/year) |
| PMI (private mortgage insurance) | $0 | $119 (until 20% equity) |
| Maintenance & repairs | $0 | $250 (1% of home value/year) |
| HOA fees (if applicable) | $0 | $0-$300+ |
| **Total monthly cost** | **$1,515** | **$2,593** |

That is a difference of over $1,000 per month. The buyer is paying $1,078 more each month than the renter. But here is the nuance: part of the buyer's payment goes toward **principal** (building ownership in the home), while 100% of the renter's payment goes to the landlord. In the first year, about $375 of that $1,761 mortgage payment goes toward principal. The rest -- $1,386 -- goes to interest, which is just as "gone" as rent.

Now look at the upfront costs:

| Upfront Cost | Renting | Buying |
|---|---|---|
| Security deposit | $1,500 | $0 |
| Down payment | $0 | $15,000 (5% of $300K) |
| Closing costs | $0 | $9,000-$15,000 (3-5% of loan) |
| Moving costs | $500-$2,000 | $500-$2,000 |
| **Total upfront** | **$2,000-$3,500** | **$24,500-$32,000** |

The bottom line: buying requires 10 to 15 times more money upfront than renting, and your monthly costs are significantly higher. Buying can still be a great decision, but only if the conditions are right.

### When Buying Makes Sense

Buying tends to be the better financial move when:

- You plan to stay in the same area for **at least 5-7 years** (ideally longer)
- You have a stable income and job security
- You have saved 10-20% for a down payment (to avoid or minimize PMI)
- You have a fully funded emergency fund **plus** a separate home repair fund
- The monthly cost of owning (including all expenses above) is not dramatically more than renting

### When Renting Makes Sense

Renting tends to be the smarter choice when:

- You might move within the next 3-5 years
- You are still building your emergency fund or paying off high-interest debt
- You live in an expensive city where buying is wildly more costly than renting
- You value flexibility and do not want to be tied to one location
- You would rather invest the difference in the stock market

!!! note "The 'Invest the Difference' Strategy"
    If renting costs you $1,000 less per month than buying, and you invest that $1,000 monthly in a low-cost index fund averaging 8% returns, after 10 years you would have about $182,000. That is real wealth, built without the risks and costs of homeownership. Renting is not "throwing money away" if you are investing the savings wisely.

### MicroSim: Rent vs. Buy Calculator

Enter your rent, home price, and down payment to see how long it takes for buying to break even compared to renting.

<iframe src="../../sims/rent-vs-buy-calculator/main.html" width="100%" height="500" style="border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:8px;" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Try this: plug in your actual rent and the price of a home you have been eyeing. Change the down payment between 5%, 10%, and 20% and notice how dramatically the breakeven timeline shifts.

## How Mortgages Work

A **mortgage** is a loan specifically for buying a home. The home itself serves as **collateral** -- meaning if you stop making payments, the bank can take the home back through a process called foreclosure. That is why mortgage interest rates are lower than credit card rates: the bank has less risk because they can seize an actual house.

Most mortgages are **30-year fixed-rate** loans, meaning you make the same monthly payment for 30 years (360 payments total). There are also 15-year mortgages (higher monthly payments but you pay far less interest overall) and adjustable-rate mortgages (the interest rate changes after an initial period, which adds risk).

Here is what surprises most first-time buyers: in the early years of a mortgage, almost all of your payment goes toward interest, not toward actually paying down the loan. This is called **amortization** -- the way your loan balance decreases over time.

On a $285,000 mortgage (that is a $300,000 home with 5% down) at 6.8% interest:

- **Month 1 payment**: $1,761 total -- of which $1,614 goes to interest and only $147 goes to principal
- **Year 5 payment**: $1,761 total -- about $1,540 to interest and $221 to principal
- **Year 15 payment**: $1,761 total -- about $1,254 to interest and $507 to principal
- **Year 25 payment**: $1,761 total -- about $672 to interest and $1,089 to principal
- **Year 30 (final payment)**: $1,761 total -- about $12 to interest and $1,749 to principal

In the first five years of a 30-year mortgage, only about 5% of the original loan gets paid off. Most of your money goes straight to the bank as interest. This is why "your mortgage payment builds equity" is only partially true, especially in the early years.

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}
\]

Where \( P \) = loan amount, \( r \) = monthly interest rate, and \( n \) = number of payments. For our example: \( P = \$285{,}000 \), \( r = 0.068/12 = 0.00567 \), \( n = 360 \).

\[
\$285{,}000 \times \frac{0.00567 \times (1.00567)^{360}}{(1.00567)^{360} - 1} = \$1{,}761/\text{month}
\]

Over the full 30 years, you will pay a total of about $634,000 on a $285,000 loan. That means you pay roughly $349,000 in interest alone -- more than the original loan amount. This is why making extra payments toward principal, even small amounts, can save you tens of thousands of dollars.

## Down Payments: How Much Do You Really Need?

A **down payment** is the upfront cash you pay toward the purchase price of a home. The rest is covered by your mortgage. The bigger your down payment, the smaller your loan, the lower your monthly payment, and the less interest you pay over the life of the mortgage.

You have probably heard that you need 20% down to buy a home. That is $60,000 on a $300,000 home. For many young adults, saving $60,000 feels impossible. The good news: you do not actually need 20% down. Many loan programs accept far less.

Here is how different down payment amounts affect your monthly costs on a $300,000 home at 6.8% interest:

| Down Payment | Amount | Loan Amount | Monthly P&I | Monthly PMI | Total Monthly (P&I + PMI) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **3%** | $9,000 | $291,000 | $1,898 | $146 | **$2,044** |
| **5%** | $15,000 | $285,000 | $1,861 | $119 | **$1,980** |
| **10%** | $30,000 | $270,000 | $1,763 | $68 | **$1,831** |
| **20%** | $60,000 | $240,000 | $1,567 | $0 | **$1,567** |

The difference between 3% down and 20% down is about $477 per month. Over 30 years, that adds up to a staggering difference. But saving an extra $51,000 for a down payment (the difference between $9,000 and $60,000) takes years, during which home prices may rise and you are still paying rent.

There is no single "right" down payment amount. Here is a practical framework:

- **3-5% down**: Gets you into a home sooner, but you pay PMI and have higher monthly costs. Best if home prices are rising fast in your area and you have stable income.
- **10% down**: A solid middle ground. Lower PMI costs and faster equity building.
- **20% down**: Eliminates PMI entirely. Lowest monthly costs. Best if you can reach this without depleting your emergency fund or delaying investing for years.

!!! warning "Do Not Drain Your Emergency Fund for a Down Payment"
    Your emergency fund should be fully intact (3-6 months of expenses) after you make your down payment. Homeownership comes with unexpected costs -- a furnace dies, a roof leaks, a pipe bursts. If you drain your savings to buy a home, the first major repair will go on a credit card and start a debt spiral.

## PMI: The Extra Cost of a Small Down Payment

**PMI** stands for **private mortgage insurance**. Despite the name, it does not protect you. It protects the lender in case you stop making payments. If you put less than 20% down on a conventional mortgage, the bank considers you a higher risk and requires you to pay PMI.

PMI typically costs between 0.5% and 1.5% of the original loan amount per year, divided into monthly payments. On a $285,000 loan, that works out to roughly $119 to $356 per month, depending on your credit score and down payment amount.

Here is the important part: PMI is not permanent. You can get rid of it once you have built 20% equity in your home. There are two ways this happens:

1. **Automatic removal at 78% loan-to-value**: Once your loan balance drops to 78% of the original purchase price through normal payments, the lender must cancel PMI automatically.
2. **Request removal at 80% loan-to-value**: Once your balance hits 80%, you can request PMI cancellation. You may need a home appraisal to prove the value has not dropped.

On our $300,000 home with 5% down, it takes roughly 8-10 years of regular payments to reach 20% equity through payments alone. If the home appreciates in value, you could reach that threshold sooner.

\[
\text{PMI Annual Cost} = \text{Loan Amount} \times \text{PMI Rate}
\]

\[
\$285{,}000 \times 0.005 = \$1{,}425/\text{year} = \$119/\text{month}
\]

Over those 8-10 years, you could pay $11,000 to $14,000 in PMI. That is real money. This is why putting 20% down is ideal if you can manage it -- but not at the cost of wiping out your savings.

## First-Time Homebuyer Programs

If you are buying your first home, there are several programs designed to make it more affordable. **First-time homebuyer** programs typically offer lower down payments, reduced interest rates, or help with closing costs. Here is an overview of the most common options.

### FHA Loans

**Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans** are government-backed mortgages with lower requirements:

- Down payment as low as **3.5%** with a credit score of 580+
- Down payment of **10%** with a credit score of 500-579
- Lower credit score requirements than conventional loans
- The catch: FHA loans require their own version of PMI (called MIP -- mortgage insurance premium) for the entire life of the loan if you put less than 10% down. You cannot cancel it like conventional PMI.

### Conventional 97 Loans

Some conventional lenders offer loans with just **3% down** for first-time buyers with good credit (typically 680+). These have cancellable PMI, which makes them potentially better than FHA loans for buyers with strong credit.

### USDA Loans

If you are buying in a rural or suburban area, **USDA loans** offer **0% down** for eligible buyers. Income limits apply, and the home must be in a USDA-eligible area (which includes more places than you might think -- it is not just farms).

### VA Loans

If you are a veteran, active-duty service member, or eligible spouse, **VA loans** offer **0% down** with no PMI. VA loans are one of the best mortgage products available, period.

### Down Payment Assistance Programs

Many states and cities offer grants or low-interest loans to help first-time buyers cover down payment and closing costs. These vary widely by location but can provide $5,000 to $25,000 in assistance. Search for "[your state] first-time homebuyer programs" to find what is available where you live.

!!! tip "Check if You Qualify"
    "First-time homebuyer" does not always mean you have never owned a home. Under many programs, it means you have not owned a home in the past three years. If you owned a home years ago but have been renting since, you may still qualify.

## House Hacking: Live for Free While Building Equity

**House hacking** is a strategy where you buy a property, live in part of it, and rent out the rest to cover your mortgage payment -- or even generate extra income. This is one of the most powerful wealth-building strategies available to young adults.

Here is a real example of how house hacking works:

**The scenario:** You buy a duplex (a building with two separate units) for $350,000 with an FHA loan at 3.5% down.

- Down payment: $12,250
- Loan amount: $337,750
- Monthly mortgage payment (P&I): $2,204
- Property taxes: $365/month
- Insurance: $175/month
- PMI: $141/month
- **Total monthly cost: $2,885**

You live in one unit and rent out the other for $1,800 per month.

- Your effective housing cost: $2,885 - $1,800 = **$1,085 per month**

That is less than the $1,500 you were paying in rent for a one-bedroom apartment, and now you are building equity in a property. If rents increase in your area, your tenant pays more over time while your mortgage stays the same.

Some house hackers go further. If you buy a property with three or four units (still eligible for residential FHA financing), the rental income from the other units can cover your entire mortgage and then some. You effectively live for free while your tenants pay off your mortgage.

House hacking is not for everyone. Being a landlord comes with responsibilities -- screening tenants, handling maintenance requests, dealing with late payments, and following landlord-tenant laws. But for those willing to put in the work, it is an incredibly effective way to build wealth in your twenties.

### Common House Hacking Strategies

- **Duplex, triplex, or fourplex**: Live in one unit, rent the others. Most popular approach.
- **Single-family home with extra bedrooms**: Rent spare rooms to roommates. Lowest barrier to entry.
- **Basement or accessory dwelling unit (ADU)**: Rent a finished basement or separate unit on your property.
- **Short-term rental**: Rent part of your home on Airbnb or similar platforms (check local regulations first).

## Closing Costs: The Expense Nobody Warns You About

**Closing costs** are the fees and expenses you pay when the home sale is finalized. They are separate from your down payment and typically run 2-5% of the loan amount. On a $300,000 home, expect to pay $6,000 to $15,000 in closing costs.

Here is a typical breakdown:

| Closing Cost Item | Typical Amount ($300K Home) |
|---|---|
| Loan origination fee (lender charge) | $1,500-$3,000 (0.5%-1% of loan) |
| Appraisal fee | $400-$600 |
| Home inspection | $300-$500 |
| Title search and title insurance | $1,000-$2,000 |
| Attorney fees (varies by state) | $500-$1,500 |
| Recording fees (county/city) | $100-$300 |
| Escrow deposit (taxes & insurance) | $2,000-$4,000 |
| Prepaid interest | $500-$1,500 |
| Survey fee | $300-$500 |
| **Total estimated closing costs** | **$6,600-$13,900** |

Some of these are negotiable. You can shop around for title insurance, negotiate the origination fee with your lender, or ask the seller to cover a portion of closing costs (called a "seller concession"). In a buyer's market, sellers may agree to cover 2-3% of closing costs to close the deal.

!!! warning "Budget for Closing Costs Separately"
    Many first-time buyers save just enough for a down payment and are shocked when they learn about closing costs. If you are saving for a home, your target should be: down payment + closing costs + moving expenses + at least $5,000 for immediate repairs or furnishing. On a $300,000 home with 5% down, that means saving roughly $30,000 to $35,000 total.

## Home Equity: How Ownership Builds Wealth

**Home equity** is the portion of your home that you actually own. It is calculated as the current market value of your home minus what you still owe on the mortgage.

\[
\text{Home Equity} = \text{Home Value} - \text{Remaining Mortgage Balance}
\]

For example, if your home is worth $300,000 and you owe $260,000 on the mortgage, your equity is $40,000. Equity builds in two ways:

1. **Paying down your mortgage**: Each monthly payment reduces your loan balance by a small amount (the principal portion). Over time, this adds up.
2. **Home appreciation**: If your home increases in value due to market conditions or improvements you make, your equity grows without you making extra payments.

Year 25:  [========================================      ]  80%

Note: Equity grows from TWO sources:
  1. Mortgage paydown (you pay off the loan over time)
  2. Home appreciation (the home increases in value at ~3%/year)

At 3% annual appreciation, a $300,000 home is worth over
$728,000 after 30 years. Your $15,000 down payment grew
into $728,182 in equity. That is the wealth-building power
of real estate -- IF you stay long enough.
```

</details>

This is where real estate gets exciting. With 3% average annual appreciation and 30 years of mortgage payments, a $15,000 down payment can grow into over $700,000 in equity. But there are important caveats:

- Home prices do not always go up. The 2008 housing crisis saw home values drop 30-50% in some areas, and many homeowners ended up **underwater** (owing more than their home was worth).
- The 3% average appreciation includes years of boom and years of stagnation. Your specific home in your specific market may do better or worse.
- You cannot easily access your home equity without selling the home or taking out a loan against it (a home equity loan or HELOC).

Home equity is real wealth, but it is **illiquid** -- meaning it is not easily converted to cash. Think of it as a long-term savings account that you happen to live in.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Here is the order to follow with your money. Notice where a home purchase fits:

1. **Build $1,000 starter emergency fund** -- Priority #1. Done before everything else.
2. **Get full employer 401(k) match** -- Free money from your employer. Covered in Chapter 11.
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** -- Credit cards, payday loans. Covered in Chapter 6.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months** -- Grow your safety net to full size. Covered in Chapter 5.
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** -- Tax-free growth. Covered in Chapter 10.
6. **Invest in low-cost index funds** -- In a taxable brokerage account. Covered in Chapter 8.
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** -- Car loans, some student loans.
8. **Save for specific goals (including a home)** -- **YOU ARE HERE.** A home purchase is a major goal, not a prerequisite for building wealth.

The key takeaway: do not rush to buy a home before your financial foundation is solid. A house can be a powerful wealth-building tool, but only if you buy at the right time, at the right price, and with the right financial cushion behind you. Renting while you invest and build savings is not falling behind -- it is being strategic.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Believing renting is "throwing money away."** Rent pays for a place to live, flexibility to move, zero maintenance costs, and freedom from property taxes. If you invest the money you save by renting, you can build serious wealth without ever owning a home.

**Mistake #2: Buying a home you cannot comfortably afford.** Just because the bank approves you for a $400,000 mortgage does not mean you should take it. A good rule: keep your total housing costs (mortgage, taxes, insurance, PMI, maintenance) under 28% of your gross monthly income. Even better, aim for 25%.

**Mistake #3: Forgetting about the hidden costs of homeownership.** Property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, HOA fees, and lawn care add 30-50% on top of your mortgage payment. Budget for all of it, not just the mortgage.

**Mistake #4: Draining your savings for the down payment.** If you empty your emergency fund and investment accounts to buy a home, the first unexpected repair will push you into debt. Keep at least 3-6 months of expenses in your emergency fund after closing.

**Mistake #5: Buying when you plan to move in 2-3 years.** Closing costs, selling costs (typically 5-6% in agent commissions), and the slow pace of early equity building mean you often lose money if you sell within the first 5 years. Renting is almost always cheaper for short stays.

**Mistake #6: Skipping the home inspection to "save money."** A $400 inspection can reveal $40,000 in hidden problems. Never skip it. If the seller will not allow an inspection, walk away.

**Mistake #7: Ignoring the opportunity cost of a down payment.** A $60,000 down payment invested in a stock index fund at 8% average returns would grow to about $129,500 in 10 years. That does not mean you should never buy, but you should weigh what your down payment money could do elsewhere.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of real estate basics.

??? question "1. On a $300,000 home with 5% down at 6.8% interest, approximately how much is the monthly principal and interest payment?"
    **About $1,761 per month.** This covers only principal and interest on the $285,000 loan. Your actual monthly housing cost will be significantly higher once you add property taxes (~$313), insurance (~$150), PMI (~$119), and maintenance (~$250), bringing the total closer to $2,593 per month.

??? question "2. What is PMI, and when can you get rid of it?"
    **PMI (private mortgage insurance) is insurance that protects the lender if you default on your loan.** You pay it when your down payment is less than 20%. It typically costs 0.5%-1.5% of the loan amount per year. You can request PMI removal when your loan balance reaches 80% of the original purchase price, and it is automatically cancelled at 78% loan-to-value.

??? question "3. You pay $1,500/month in rent. A comparable home costs $300,000 with 5% down. Roughly how much more would you pay each month as a homeowner?"
    **About $1,078 more per month.** Renting costs approximately $1,515/month (rent plus renter's insurance), while owning costs approximately $2,593/month (mortgage, taxes, insurance, PMI, and maintenance). However, about $147-$375 of the homeowner's payment builds equity in the first few years.

??? question "4. What is house hacking?"
    **House hacking is buying a property, living in part of it, and renting out the rest to cover your mortgage.** For example, you buy a duplex for $350,000, live in one unit, and rent the other for $1,800/month. This reduces your effective housing cost from $2,885 to $1,085/month while building equity. Properties with up to four units still qualify for residential financing like FHA loans.

??? question "5. On a 30-year mortgage, how much of your early payments goes to principal versus interest?"
    **In the early years, the vast majority goes to interest.** On a $285,000 loan at 6.8%, your first monthly payment of $1,761 sends about $1,614 to interest and only $147 to principal. This ratio slowly shifts over time. By year 25, about $1,089 goes to principal and $672 to interest. Over 30 years, you pay roughly $349,000 in total interest on a $285,000 loan.

??? question "6. What are closing costs, and how much should you expect to pay?"
    **Closing costs are fees paid when the home sale is finalized, separate from your down payment.** They typically run 2-5% of the loan amount and include lender fees, appraisal, inspection, title insurance, attorney fees, escrow deposits, and other charges. On a $300,000 home, expect $6,600 to $13,900 in closing costs.

## Key Terms

- **Real Estate**: Land and any buildings or structures permanently attached to it. In personal finance, usually refers to property purchased as a place to live or as an investment.

- **Renting vs. Buying**: The decision between paying a landlord for housing (renting) or purchasing a home with a mortgage (buying). Neither is universally better; the right choice depends on your financial situation, location, time horizon, and lifestyle goals.

- **Mortgage**: A loan specifically for purchasing real estate, where the property itself serves as collateral. Most common is the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, where the interest rate and monthly payment stay the same for the entire loan term.

- **Down Payment**: The upfront cash you pay toward the purchase price of a home, expressed as a percentage of the price. Common amounts range from 3% to 20%. A larger down payment means a smaller loan, lower monthly payments, and potentially no PMI.

- **PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)**: Insurance required by lenders when your down payment is less than 20%. It protects the lender (not you) if you default. PMI typically costs 0.5%-1.5% of the loan amount per year and can be removed once you reach 20% equity.

- **First-Time Homebuyer**: A designation that qualifies you for special loan programs with lower down payments, reduced rates, or down payment assistance. Under most programs, "first-time" means you have not owned a home in the past three years.

- **House Hacking**: A strategy where you buy a multi-unit property (or a home with extra space), live in part of it, and rent out the rest to offset or fully cover your mortgage payment. This builds equity while reducing or eliminating your housing cost.

- **Closing Costs**: Fees and expenses paid when a home purchase is finalized, separate from the down payment. Typically 2-5% of the loan amount, covering lender fees, appraisal, title insurance, escrow, and other charges.

- **Home Equity**: The portion of your home's value that you actually own, calculated as the home's current market value minus the remaining mortgage balance. Equity builds through mortgage payments and home price appreciation.

## What To Do This Week

Here is your action plan. Do these in order.

- [ ] **Day 1**: Check the priority framework. Are your emergency fund, 401(k) match, and high-interest debts handled? If not, focus there before thinking about homeownership. There is no rush.
- [ ] **Day 2**: Calculate your rent-to-buy ratio. Look up the median home price in your area and compare the total monthly cost of owning (mortgage + taxes + insurance + PMI + maintenance) to your current rent. If owning costs more than 1.5 times your rent, renting is likely the better financial move for now.
- [ ] **Day 3**: If buying is on your radar, calculate how much you need to save. Add up: down payment (aim for at least 10%) + closing costs (budget 4% of loan amount) + a $5,000 home repair cushion. Set a savings target and timeline.
- [ ] **Day 4**: Research first-time homebuyer programs in your state. Search "[your state] first-time homebuyer programs 2025" and make a list of programs you might qualify for. Many offer $5,000-$25,000 in down payment assistance.
- [ ] **Day 5**: If you are interested in house hacking, look at duplex and triplex listings in your area on Zillow or Realtor.com. Compare the purchase price to the rental income potential. See if the numbers work.
- [ ] **Weekend**: Whether you plan to buy in 2 years or 10 years, open a dedicated high-yield savings account labeled "Home Fund" and set up a small automatic monthly transfer. Even $100/month adds up to $6,000 in 5 years before interest. Starting the habit is what matters.

Buying a home can be one of the best financial decisions you ever make, or one of the worst. The difference comes down to timing, preparation, and math. Do not let anyone pressure you into buying before you are ready. Renting while you build your financial foundation is not falling behind -- it is setting yourself up to buy smart when the time is right.
