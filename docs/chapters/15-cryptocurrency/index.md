## Introduction: Yes, We Need to Talk About Crypto

You have probably seen the headlines. Someone bought Bitcoin for pennies and became a millionaire. Someone else lost their life savings in a crypto crash overnight. Your coworker will not stop talking about Ethereum. A celebrity is promoting a new coin on social media. Crypto is everywhere, and as a young adult, you are the target audience for almost every crypto pitch out there.

Here is the honest truth: cryptocurrency is a real technology with real applications. It is not a scam by definition, and it is not magic internet money that will make you rich by next Tuesday. It sits somewhere in between, and understanding where it actually fits in your financial life is critical.

This chapter will teach you what cryptocurrency actually is, how the technology works, what the real risks look like, and most importantly, where crypto belongs in your financial priorities. Spoiler: it is not at the top of the list. Not even close.

!!! warning "Crypto Is NOT in the Priority Framework"
    Cryptocurrency is a speculative investment. It should only be considered AFTER you have completed Priorities 1 through 6: starter emergency fund, employer 401(k) match, high-interest debt elimination, full emergency fund, maxing out your Roth IRA, and investing in low-cost index funds. If you have not done all six of those things, close the crypto app and come back later.

## What Is Cryptocurrency?

**Cryptocurrency** is digital money that exists only on computers and uses advanced math (called cryptography) to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Unlike the U.S. dollar, which is issued and regulated by the Federal Reserve (a central bank), most cryptocurrencies are **decentralized**, meaning no single government, company, or person controls them.

Think of it this way: when you send $50 to a friend through Venmo, your bank and Venmo both act as middlemen to verify the transaction. With cryptocurrency, the verification happens through a network of thousands of computers around the world, with no bank or company in the middle. The transaction is recorded on a shared digital record book that everyone can see but nobody can secretly alter.

There are thousands of different cryptocurrencies. The vast majority are worthless or outright scams. The two that matter most are Bitcoin and Ethereum, which together make up roughly 60-70% of the total crypto market value. We will focus on those.

## Blockchain: The Technology Behind Crypto

**Blockchain** is the technology that makes cryptocurrency work. A blockchain is a digital ledger (a record of transactions) that is shared across thousands of computers simultaneously. Every time someone sends crypto to someone else, that transaction gets recorded in a "block." When a block fills up with transactions, it gets permanently linked to the previous block, forming a chain. That is where the name comes from: a chain of blocks.

#### Diagram: How Blockchain Works

<details><summary>Blockchain - A Chain of Transaction Records</summary>

```
HOW A BLOCKCHAIN WORKS (Simplified)

Each "block" contains a batch of verified transactions.
Once sealed, a block cannot be changed.

</details>

Here is why blockchain matters: because every computer in the network has an identical copy of the entire transaction history, it is nearly impossible to fake or alter a transaction after the fact. If someone tried to change a past transaction on one computer, it would not match the copies on the other thousands of computers and would be rejected.

This is a genuine technological innovation. Whether you ever buy a single cryptocurrency or not, blockchain technology itself is being adopted by banks, supply chain companies, healthcare systems, and governments for record-keeping and verification. The technology has real value even if any individual cryptocurrency does not.

## Bitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency

**Bitcoin** (abbreviated BTC) was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was the first cryptocurrency and remains the largest by market value. Think of Bitcoin as digital gold: it is scarce (only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist), it is not controlled by any government, and people buy it primarily as a store of value.

Here are the key facts about Bitcoin:

- **Total supply:** Capped at 21 million coins. As of early 2025, roughly 19.6 million have already been created ("mined"). This built-in scarcity is a major reason people believe Bitcoin will hold or increase in value over time.
- **How new Bitcoin is created:** Through a process called "mining," where powerful computers solve complex math problems to verify transactions and earn new Bitcoin as a reward.
- **What it is used for:** Primarily as a store of value and speculative investment. Some businesses accept Bitcoin as payment, but day-to-day use as currency remains limited due to slow transaction speeds and high fees.
- **Price history:** Bitcoin has gone from less than $0.01 in 2009 to an all-time high near $69,000 in November 2021, then crashed to around $16,000 in late 2022, and recovered to new highs above $100,000 in late 2024 and into 2025.

The most important thing to understand about Bitcoin is that it produces nothing. Unlike a stock, which represents ownership of a company that generates revenue and profits, Bitcoin generates no earnings, pays no dividends, and creates no products. Its value is based entirely on what the next person is willing to pay for it. This is fundamentally different from investing in a business.

## Ethereum: The Programmable Blockchain

**Ethereum** (abbreviated ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. Created by Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015, Ethereum is different from Bitcoin in a crucial way: it is not just digital money. It is a programmable platform that allows developers to build applications on top of its blockchain.

Think of it this way: if Bitcoin is like digital gold, Ethereum is more like a digital operating system. Just as developers build apps for your iPhone's operating system, developers build decentralized applications (called "dApps") on Ethereum. These include decentralized lending platforms, digital art marketplaces, and financial tools that run without banks or middlemen.

The key innovation of Ethereum is something called **smart contracts**: self-executing agreements written in code. For example, a smart contract could be programmed to automatically release payment to a freelancer once both parties confirm the work is complete, with no need for a middleman like PayPal or an escrow service.

Is Ethereum useful technology? Potentially, yes. Does that mean buying ETH is a good investment? Not necessarily. The value of the Ethereum network and the price of the ETH token are not the same thing. The internet is incredibly valuable technology, but plenty of internet companies went bankrupt during the dot-com crash. Being real technology does not guarantee the token price goes up.

## Bitcoin vs. Ethereum vs. Traditional Investments

To understand where crypto fits, you need to see it compared to the investments you already know from earlier chapters.

| Feature | **Bitcoin** | **Ethereum** | **S&P 500 Index Fund** | **Savings Account** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **What you own** | Digital token | Digital token + platform access | Shares of 500 real companies | Cash in a bank |
| **Produces income?** | No | No (unless you "stake" it) | Yes (dividends) | Yes (interest) |
| **Backed by** | Scarcity and demand | Technology platform and demand | Company earnings and profits | FDIC insurance (up to $250K) |
| **Typical annual volatility** | 50-80% | 60-100% | 15-20% | 0% |
| **Worst single-year loss** | -73% (2022) | -67% (2022) | -38% (2008) | 0% |
| **Historical avg. annual return** | Highly variable, depends on start date | Highly variable, depends on start date | ~10% over 100 years | 0.5-5% depending on era |
| **Regulated?** | Partially (evolving) | Partially (evolving) | Yes (SEC regulated) | Yes (FDIC insured) |
| **Can lose everything?** | Theoretically possible | Theoretically possible | Extremely unlikely (500 companies) | No (if under $250K) |

Notice the volatility row. The S&P 500 might swing 15-20% in a bad year. Bitcoin can swing 50-80%. That means a $10,000 Bitcoin investment could drop to $2,000 in a bad year. That same $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund might drop to $8,000 in its worst year and has always recovered. These are completely different risk levels.

## Crypto Volatility: The Rollercoaster Is Real

**Crypto volatility** refers to how dramatically and quickly cryptocurrency prices swing up and down. This is not normal investment volatility. This is something else entirely. Let us look at the actual history.

| Event | Peak Price | Crash Low | Drop | Time Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bitcoin 2017-2018** | ~$19,700 | ~$3,200 | -84% | Dec 2017 - Dec 2018 |
| **Bitcoin 2021-2022** | ~$69,000 | ~$15,500 | -77% | Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 |
| **Ethereum 2021-2022** | ~$4,800 | ~$880 | -82% | Nov 2021 - Jun 2022 |
| **Luna/TerraUSD 2022** | ~$119 | ~$0.00 | -100% | Apr 2022 - May 2022 |
| **FTX collapse 2022** | Exchange valued at $32B | $0 (bankrupt) | -100% | Nov 2022 |

Look at that table carefully. Bitcoin dropped 77% from its high in about one year. That means if you invested $10,000 at the peak, your investment shrank to $2,300. Ethereum dropped 82%, turning $10,000 into $1,800. Luna went to literally zero. FTX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, collapsed entirely and customers lost billions.

Now here is what makes crypto volatility especially dangerous for young investors: the drops do not feel gradual. They can happen in days or weeks, not months. Bitcoin lost 50% of its value in just eight weeks during the 2022 crash. Imagine watching $5,000 of your hard-earned money evaporate in two months. That is the emotional reality of crypto investing.

Yes, Bitcoin has also recovered and reached new all-time highs after every major crash so far. But "so far" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. Bitcoin has only existed since 2009. The S&P 500 has over 100 years of crash-and-recovery data. We simply do not have enough history to know for certain that crypto will always recover.

> **Real talk:** If seeing your investment drop 50% or more would cause you to panic-sell, lose sleep, or affect your mental health, crypto is not for you. There is no shame in that. The S&P 500 will build you plenty of wealth with a fraction of the stress.

## Portfolio Allocation: The 5% Rule

**Portfolio allocation** is how you divide your total investment money across different types of assets. In Chapter 8, you learned about diversification and spreading risk. The question with crypto is: how much of your portfolio, if any, should go into it?

Most respected financial advisors and institutions that are open to crypto at all recommend the same thing: **no more than 5% of your total investment portfolio.** Some say 1-3%. Almost none say more than 5%.

Here is what that looks like in practice. Say you have $10,000 invested total:

- **95% in traditional investments:** $9,500 in low-cost index funds (S&P 500, total market, international)
- **5% in crypto:** $500 in Bitcoin and/or Ethereum

That is it. Five hundred dollars. If that $500 drops 80%, you lose $400. Painful, but it will not wreck your financial life. Your remaining $9,500 in index funds keeps compounding and growing. If that $500 triples, great, you made $1,000 of bonus money on top of your solid investment foundation.

### MicroSim: Portfolio Allocation Visualizer

Use the interactive tool below to see what different crypto allocation percentages look like in a balanced portfolio. Adjust the crypto percentage and see how it affects your overall portfolio risk and potential outcomes.

<iframe src="../../sims/portfolio-allocation-visualizer/main.html" width="100%" height="600px" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notice how increasing crypto beyond 5% dramatically increases your portfolio's overall volatility without a proportional increase in expected returns. The risk-reward tradeoff gets worse, not better, as you add more crypto.

### Why Only 5%?

The logic is simple:

- **If crypto does well:** A 5% allocation that doubles adds a nice 5% boost to your total portfolio. That is meaningful.
- **If crypto crashes:** A 5% allocation that drops 80% only costs you 4% of your total portfolio. That is survivable.
- **If crypto goes to zero:** You lose 5% of your portfolio. Uncomfortable but not devastating. Your other 95% is intact.

Now imagine you put 50% of your money in crypto and it drops 80%. You just lost 40% of your entire net worth. That could set you back years or decades. The 5% rule is about protecting your financial future while still allowing some exposure to an asset class that might (emphasis on might) have significant upside.

## NFTs: What They Are and What Happened

**NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital tokens that represent ownership of a specific digital item, like a piece of art, a video clip, or a collectible. "Non-fungible" means one-of-a-kind and not interchangeable. A dollar bill is fungible because any dollar is worth the same as any other dollar. An original painting is non-fungible because there is only one of it.

NFTs gained massive attention in 2021 when digital artwork sold for millions of dollars. Beeple, a digital artist, sold an NFT collage for $69 million at Christie's auction house. Bored Ape Yacht Club profile picture NFTs sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Celebrities, athletes, and influencers rushed to create and promote NFTs.

Then reality set in. Here is what happened:

- By 2023, a study by dappGambl found that an estimated 95% of NFT collections had a market value of zero.
- The average NFT that sold for thousands of dollars in 2021 lost over 90% of its value.
- Many high-profile NFT projects turned out to be outright scams, with creators disappearing with investor money (called "rug pulls").
- The Bored Ape Yacht Club floor price dropped from over $400,000 per ape to under $30,000.

Does the underlying technology have potential applications? Possibly. NFTs could be useful for things like digital event tickets, proof of ownership for real estate documents, or verifying credentials. But as investments, the vast majority of NFTs have proven to be speculative bubbles.

**The bottom line on NFTs:** Do not buy NFTs as investments. If you want to support a digital artist whose work you genuinely love and you are comfortable spending money you can afford to lose entirely, that is a personal choice. But never treat NFTs as part of your investment strategy.

## Crypto Exchanges: Where People Buy and Sell

A **crypto exchange** is a platform where you can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency. It works similarly to a stock brokerage but for crypto instead of stocks. Some exchanges also offer features like staking (earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies) and lending.

Choosing a crypto exchange matters because this is where your money and crypto are stored. If the exchange gets hacked, goes bankrupt, or turns out to be fraudulent, you can lose everything. Remember FTX, which was the second-largest crypto exchange in the world before it collapsed in November 2022? Customers lost roughly $8 billion.

Here are the major regulated exchanges available in the United States:

| Exchange | **Coinbase** | **Kraken** | **Gemini** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Founded** | 2012 | 2011 | 2014 |
| **Publicly traded?** | Yes (NASDAQ: COIN) | No | No |
| **Trading fees** | 0%-0.60% (Advanced Trade) | 0%-0.40% | 0.20%-0.40% (ActiveTrader) |
| **Number of cryptos** | 250+ | 200+ | 100+ |
| **Security features** | 2FA, insurance on hot wallet | 2FA, proof of reserves | 2FA, SOC 2 certified |
| **Beginner friendly?** | Yes | Moderate | Yes |
| **FDIC insured?** | Only USD cash balances | Only USD cash balances | Only USD cash balances |

A few critical notes about exchanges:

**Your crypto is NOT FDIC insured.** When you hold U.S. dollars in an exchange account, that cash portion may be FDIC insured up to $250,000. But the cryptocurrency itself has no government insurance. If the exchange is hacked and your Bitcoin is stolen, there is no FDIC to make you whole.

**"Not your keys, not your coins."** This is a common saying in the crypto world. When your crypto sits on an exchange, the exchange controls the private keys (the passwords that prove ownership). If you hold significant amounts of crypto, many experts recommend transferring it to a personal hardware wallet (a physical USB-like device) that only you control. This protects you from exchange hacks and bankruptcies but adds the risk that if you lose your wallet or forget your password, your crypto is gone permanently.

**Stick with regulated, established exchanges.** Do not use obscure exchanges offering "zero fees" or "10x returns." If it sounds too good to be true, it absolutely is. The three exchanges in the table above are among the most established and regulated in the United States. Even so, they are not risk-free.

## Crypto Security: Protecting Yourself

If you do decide to put a small amount of money into crypto, security is non-negotiable. Crypto theft is permanent. There is no bank to call, no fraud department to file a claim with, and no government agency that will get your money back. Here are the minimum security steps:

1. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)** on your exchange account. Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS text messages (which can be hacked through SIM swapping).
2. **Use a unique, strong password** for your exchange account. Do not reuse a password from any other website.
3. **Be extremely skeptical of anyone contacting you about crypto.** No legitimate exchange will ever ask for your password, seed phrase, or private keys. Anyone who does is trying to steal from you.
4. **Never share your seed phrase.** A seed phrase is a series of 12 or 24 words that can restore access to your crypto wallet. Write it down on paper and store it somewhere physically secure. Never type it into a website, never screenshot it, never store it in your email.
5. **Watch out for scams.** If someone promises guaranteed returns, says you need to "act now," or asks you to send crypto to receive more crypto back, it is a scam. Every single time.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Check

Let us be very direct about this. Cryptocurrency is not in the financial priority framework for this course, and for good reason. Here is the priority list again with crypto placed where it actually belongs:

**Priority 1:** Build a $1,000 starter emergency fund.

**Priority 2:** Get your full employer 401(k) match (free money).

**Priority 3:** Pay off all high-interest debt above 7%.

**Priority 4:** Build your emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses.

**Priority 5:** Max out your Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025).

**Priority 6:** Invest in low-cost index funds.

**Priority 7:** Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%).

**Priority 8:** Save for specific goals.

**Only after ALL of the above:** Consider putting up to 5% of your investment portfolio in cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin and/or Ethereum.

If you are 24 years old, making $45,000 a year, and you still have $8,000 in credit card debt at 22% interest, buying Bitcoin is one of the worst things you can do with your money. That credit card debt is costing you a guaranteed $1,760 per year in interest. Bitcoin might go up 50% next year, or it might drop 50%. Your credit card interest rate is a certainty. Pay off the debt first.

If you have no emergency fund and your car breaks down, you cannot pay the mechanic with Bitcoin. You need actual dollars in an actual savings account for actual emergencies.

Crypto is the dessert of personal finance. It is not the meal. Do not eat dessert until you have finished your vegetables.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Putting money into crypto before completing Priorities 1-6.**
This is the biggest mistake by far. Every dollar in crypto before you have an emergency fund, zero high-interest debt, and a solid index fund portfolio is a dollar in the wrong place. The boring stuff comes first because the boring stuff actually works.

**Mistake 2: Investing more than 5% of your portfolio in crypto.**
The more crypto you hold, the more your overall portfolio behaves like a rollercoaster. A 5% allocation gives you exposure to potential upside while protecting 95% of your wealth in proven, income-generating investments.

**Mistake 3: Buying altcoins or meme coins.**
There are over 20,000 cryptocurrencies. The vast majority will go to zero. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and whatever new meme coin is trending this week are gambling, not investing. If you want crypto exposure, stick to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Period.

**Mistake 4: Trying to time the crypto market.**
If timing the stock market is nearly impossible (as we covered in Chapter 9), timing the crypto market is even harder because the swings are larger and more unpredictable. Do not try to buy the dip or sell the top. If you allocate 5%, set it and leave it alone.

**Mistake 5: Leaving large amounts on an exchange.**
If your crypto holdings are worth more than you would be comfortable losing entirely, consider moving them to a personal hardware wallet. Exchange hacks and bankruptcies are real and have cost investors billions.

**Mistake 6: Falling for crypto scams and influencer hype.**
If a YouTuber, TikToker, or celebrity is promoting a specific cryptocurrency, they are almost certainly being paid to do so, and they likely bought in early so they profit when you buy and drive the price up. Do your own research. Trust data, not hype.

**Mistake 7: Thinking crypto is a shortcut to wealth.**
There is no shortcut. The people who got rich from Bitcoin mostly bought it years ago, held through multiple 80% crashes, and got lucky on timing. Survivorship bias means you hear about the winners. You do not hear about the millions of people who bought crypto, lost money, and quietly moved on. Consistent investing in index funds is boring, but it works reliably.

## What to Do This Week

Here is your action plan. These steps are designed to help you understand crypto without risking money you cannot afford to lose.

- [ ] **Day 1:** Check your progress on Priorities 1-6. Have you built your emergency fund? Are you getting your full 401(k) match? Is your high-interest debt gone? Are you investing in index funds? Write down which priorities you still need to complete before even thinking about crypto.
- [ ] **Day 2:** Look up the current price of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Write down the numbers. Check again in one week to see how much they changed. Compare that to how much the S&P 500 changed in the same week. This will help you viscerally understand crypto volatility.
- [ ] **Day 3:** Google "biggest crypto crashes" and read about at least two of them. Read the stories of real people who lost real money. Understanding the downside is more important than imagining the upside.
- [ ] **Day 4:** If you have completed Priorities 1-6 and want to allocate up to 5% to crypto, calculate what 5% of your current investment portfolio equals. That is your maximum crypto budget.
- [ ] **Day 5:** Research Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini. Compare their fees, security features, and user reviews. Do NOT sign up or deposit money yet. Just research.
- [ ] **Day 6:** Ask yourself honestly: if your crypto investment dropped 80% tomorrow, would you panic? Would it affect your ability to pay bills? If the answer to either question is yes, you are not ready for crypto. Focus on Priorities 1-6 instead.
- [ ] **Day 7:** Talk to a friend who is interested in crypto. Share the 5% rule and the priority framework. If they are putting money into crypto before they have an emergency fund or while carrying credit card debt, you might help them avoid a costly mistake.
