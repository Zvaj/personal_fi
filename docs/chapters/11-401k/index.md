## Introduction: Don't Leave Free Money on the Table

Imagine your boss walks up to you and says, "Hey, for every dollar you set aside for retirement, I'll hand you a dollar too. Up to a certain amount." You would take that deal instantly, right? That is exactly what an employer 401(k) match is. It is free money added to your retirement account just for participating.

Yet roughly one in five eligible workers does not contribute enough to get their full employer match. That means millions of people are literally saying "no thanks" to free money every single paycheck.

Getting your full employer match is **Priority #2** in your financial plan, right after building your $1,000 starter emergency fund. It comes *before* paying off high-interest debt. It comes *before* maxing out a Roth IRA. Why? Because no debt payoff strategy and no investment can guarantee you an instant 50% to 100% return on your money. An employer match does exactly that.

This chapter will walk you through everything you need to know about 401(k) plans, employer benefits, and one of the best-kept secrets in personal finance: the HSA triple tax advantage. By the end, you will know exactly how to capture every dollar your employer is willing to give you.

## What Is a 401(k)?

A **401(k)** is a retirement savings account offered through your employer. The name comes from Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code -- not exactly exciting, but the benefits are. Here is what makes a 401(k) special compared to a regular savings account:

- **Tax advantages** -- your contributions either reduce your taxable income now (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). We will break down the difference shortly.
- **Employer matching** -- many employers will add their own money to your account when you contribute. This is the free money we keep talking about.
- **Automatic payroll deductions** -- money comes out of your paycheck before you ever see it, making saving effortless.
- **High contribution limits** -- you can contribute up to **$23,500 per year** in 2025, which is far more than the $7,000 Roth IRA limit you learned about in Chapter 10.

### How It Works in Practice

When you start a new job that offers a 401(k), you choose a percentage of your paycheck to contribute. That money is automatically deducted each pay period and invested in the funds you select within the plan. You pick from a menu of investment options, typically a mix of stock funds, bond funds, and target-date funds.

Here is a simple example. Say you earn $40,000 a year and decide to contribute 6% of your pay:

- \( \$40{,}000 \times 0.06 = \$2{,}400 \) per year
- That is \( \$2{,}400 \div 24 = \$100 \) per paycheck (if paid twice a month)

That $100 per paycheck goes straight into your 401(k) before you can spend it. Over time, it gets invested and grows through compound interest, the same force you learned about in Chapter 8.

---

## Employer Match: The Best Deal in Personal Finance

An **employer match** is when your company contributes additional money to your 401(k) based on how much you put in. Think of it as a bonus that shows up every paycheck, but only if you participate.

Common match formulas include:

- **Dollar-for-dollar up to a percentage** -- your employer matches 100% of your contribution, up to a cap. Example: 100% match on the first 3% of your salary.
- **Fifty cents on the dollar** -- your employer puts in $0.50 for every $1.00 you contribute, up to a cap. Example: 50% match on the first 6% of your salary.
- **Tiered matching** -- different match rates at different levels. Example: 100% on the first 3%, then 50% on the next 2%.

The most common formula in the United States is a **50% match on the first 6% of your salary**. That effectively means if you contribute 6%, your employer adds another 3%. Let that sink in: 3% of your salary, handed to you for free.

### Employer Match at Three Salary Levels

Here is what the numbers look like at different salaries, using the most common match formula (50% match on first 6%):

| | Salary: $40,000 | Salary: $60,000 | Salary: $80,000 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Your contribution (6%) | $2,400/year | $3,600/year | $4,800/year |
| Employer match (3%) | **$1,200/year** | **$1,800/year** | **$2,400/year** |
| Total going into your 401(k) | $3,600/year | $5,400/year | $7,200/year |
| Free money over 10 years | $12,000+ | $18,000+ | $24,000+ |
| Free money over 30 years | $36,000+ | $54,000+ | $72,000+ |

!!! warning "This Is Not Optional"
    If you earn $40,000 and your employer offers a 50% match on the first 6%, not contributing at least 6% means you are **throwing away $1,200 every single year**. Over a 30-year career, that is $36,000 in free money you never received -- and that is before investment growth. With average market returns, that lost match could grow to over $100,000. There is no financial strategy that can make up for turning down free money.

### What If Your Employer Matches Dollar-for-Dollar?

Some employers are even more generous. If your company offers a 100% match on the first 3%, here is how the numbers change:

| | Salary: $40,000 | Salary: $60,000 | Salary: $80,000 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Your contribution (3%) | $1,200/year | $1,800/year | $2,400/year |
| Employer match (3%) | **$1,200/year** | **$1,800/year** | **$2,400/year** |
| Total going into your 401(k) | $2,400/year | $3,600/year | $4,800/year |

With a dollar-for-dollar match, your money doubles instantly. That is a 100% return on your investment on day one. No stock, no crypto, no side hustle can guarantee that.

### But What Do I Actually DO With This?

1. **Find out your employer's match formula.** Check your benefits portal, ask HR, or look at the benefits packet you received when you were hired.
2. **At minimum, contribute enough to get the full match.** If the match is 50% on 6%, contribute at least 6%. If it is 100% on 3%, contribute at least 3%.
3. **Set this up on your first day if possible.** Many companies auto-enroll new employees at 3%, which might not be enough to capture the full match. Double-check and increase if needed.

## Traditional vs Roth 401(k)

Most employers now offer two flavors of 401(k): **Traditional** and **Roth**. The core difference is simple: do you want to pay taxes now, or pay taxes later?

A **Traditional 401(k)** uses pre-tax dollars. Your contributions reduce your taxable income today, so you pay less in taxes right now. But when you withdraw the money in retirement, you pay income tax on everything -- your contributions and all the growth.

A **Roth 401(k)** uses after-tax dollars. You pay taxes on the money before it goes in, so your paycheck feels a bit smaller today. But when you withdraw the money in retirement, it is completely tax-free -- contributions and all the growth.

Here is a side-by-side comparison:

| Feature | Traditional 401(k) | Roth 401(k) |
|---|---|---|
| Tax on contributions | No tax now (pre-tax) | Taxed now (after-tax) |
| Tax on withdrawals | Taxed as income | **Tax-free** |
| Tax on investment growth | Taxed when withdrawn | **Tax-free** |
| Effect on today's paycheck | Larger (lower taxes now) | Smaller (taxes paid now) |
| Best if you expect... | Lower tax rate in retirement | Higher tax rate in retirement |
| 2025 contribution limit | $23,500 | $23,500 |
| Required minimum distributions | Yes, at age 73 | Yes, at age 73 (but can roll to Roth IRA to avoid) |
| Employer match goes into... | Traditional (pre-tax) account | Traditional (pre-tax) account* |

*Even if you choose Roth 401(k) contributions, your employer's matching dollars always go into a Traditional (pre-tax) account. This is a tax rule, not an employer choice.

### Which One Should You Pick?

For most young adults, the **Roth 401(k)** is likely the better choice. Here is why:

- You are probably in a lower tax bracket now than you will be later in your career. Paying taxes at today's low rate and then withdrawing tax-free in retirement is a great deal.
- Tax-free growth over 30 to 40 years is enormously powerful. The bigger your account grows, the more valuable that tax-free status becomes.
- Nobody knows what tax rates will look like in 30 years. Locking in tax-free withdrawals now eliminates that uncertainty.

However, the Traditional 401(k) might make sense if you are in a high tax bracket today and expect to be in a much lower bracket in retirement, or if you need the immediate tax deduction to manage your current budget.

!!! tip "Not Sure? Split It"
    Some employers let you split contributions between Traditional and Roth. You could put 50% in each. This gives you tax diversification in retirement -- some taxable money and some tax-free money -- which gives you flexibility no matter what happens with tax rates.

### A Quick Math Example

Say you contribute $200 per paycheck to your 401(k) and you are in the 22% federal tax bracket:

- **Traditional 401(k):** The full $200 goes in. Your paycheck only drops by about $156 (because you save $44 in taxes). But you will owe taxes on every dollar when you withdraw.
- **Roth 401(k):** The full $200 goes in, but your paycheck drops by the full $200 (taxes already paid). When you withdraw in retirement, every dollar is tax-free.

The contribution limit of **$23,500 for 2025** applies to the total of your Traditional and Roth 401(k) contributions combined. You cannot put $23,500 in each.

---

## Vesting Schedules: When the Free Money Is Actually Yours

Here is something that trips up a lot of people. Just because your employer puts matching money into your 401(k) does not mean you get to keep it immediately. Many companies use a **vesting schedule** that determines how much of the employer match you actually own based on how long you have worked there.

A **vesting schedule** is a timeline that dictates when employer contributions become fully yours. Your own contributions are always 100% yours from day one. It is only the employer's matching dollars that might have a vesting schedule attached.

There are two common types:

**Cliff vesting** -- you own 0% of the match until a specific date (usually 3 years), then you own 100% all at once.

**Graded vesting** -- you gradually earn ownership over several years.

Here is what a typical graded vesting schedule looks like:

| Years of Service | Percentage Vested | What You Keep (on $1,200 match) |
|---|---|---|
| Less than 1 year | 0% | $0 |
| 1 year | 20% | $240 |
| 2 years | 40% | $480 |
| 3 years | 60% | $720 |
| 4 years | 80% | $960 |
| 5 years | 100% | **$1,200** |

### Why This Matters

If you leave a job after 2 years with a graded vesting schedule, you only keep 40% of the employer match. On a $1,200 annual match, that means $720 stays in your account and $480 goes back to the employer.

This does NOT mean you should avoid contributing. The match is still free money -- even keeping 40% of it is better than keeping 0%. But it is something to factor into your decision if you are thinking about leaving a job. If you are at 80% vested and your 5-year mark is three months away, it might be worth sticking around to capture that last 20%.

### But What Do I Actually DO With This?

1. **Ask HR about your vesting schedule** when you start a new job.
2. **Check your 401(k) statement.** It should show your "vested balance" separately from your total balance.
3. **Factor vesting into job-change decisions.** If you are close to a vesting milestone, do the math before you leave.

## What Happens When You Change Jobs: The 401(k) Rollover

The average person changes jobs about 12 times during their career. That means you will eventually face this question: what do I do with my old 401(k)?

A **401(k) rollover** is the process of moving money from an old employer's 401(k) into another retirement account. You have four options:

| Option | What Happens | Recommended? |
|---|---|---|
| **Roll over to an IRA** | Move the money to a Traditional or Roth IRA at a brokerage like Fidelity or Vanguard | **Best option for most people** |
| **Roll over to new employer's 401(k)** | Transfer to your new job's plan | Good if the new plan has great funds |
| **Leave it in old employer's plan** | Money stays where it is | Fine short-term, but you may forget about it |
| **Cash it out** | Take the money as cash | **Almost always a terrible idea** |

### Why Rolling Over to an IRA Is Usually Best

When you roll your old 401(k) into an IRA, you get several advantages:

- **More investment choices.** Most 401(k) plans offer 20-30 fund options. An IRA at Fidelity or Vanguard gives you access to thousands, often with lower fees.
- **Lower fees.** Many 401(k) plans charge administrative fees. IRAs at major brokerages often have no account fees.
- **Simplicity.** Instead of having old 401(k) accounts scattered across former employers, you have everything in one place.

### Why You Should Never Cash Out

If you cash out your 401(k) before age 59 and a half, you will owe income taxes on the entire amount plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty. On a $10,000 balance in the 22% tax bracket:

- Federal income tax: \( \$10{,}000 \times 0.22 = \$2{,}200 \)
- Early withdrawal penalty: \( \$10{,}000 \times 0.10 = \$1{,}000 \)
- **You keep only $6,800 out of $10,000**

And you lose all the future growth that money would have generated. That $10,000 invested for 30 years at 7% average returns would have grown to about $76,000. Cashing out costs you far more than you realize.

### How to Do a Rollover: Step by Step

1. **Open an IRA** at your preferred brokerage (Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab are all excellent choices).
2. **Contact your old 401(k) provider** and request a "direct rollover" to your new IRA. Emphasize "direct rollover" -- this means the money goes straight from your old account to your new account without you touching it, which avoids any tax issues.
3. **Choose your investments** in the new IRA. A target-date fund or a simple three-fund portfolio (as covered in Chapter 10) are solid starting points.
4. **Confirm the transfer.** It usually takes 1-3 weeks. Check both accounts to make sure the money arrived.

!!! tip "Rolling Over a Traditional 401(k) to a Roth IRA"
    You can roll a Traditional 401(k) into a Roth IRA, but you will owe income taxes on the converted amount since the money was never taxed. This is called a Roth conversion. It can be a smart move if you are in a low tax bracket and want tax-free growth going forward, but make sure you have cash on hand to pay the tax bill. Do not use the retirement funds themselves to pay the taxes.

## HSA: The Secret Weapon of Employee Benefits

If your employer offers a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), you likely have access to a **Health Savings Account (HSA)**. Most people think of an HSA as just a medical spending account. It is actually one of the most powerful tax-advantaged accounts in existence.

An **HSA** is a tax-advantaged savings account designed to help you pay for qualified medical expenses. To be eligible, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (in 2025, that means a plan with a deductible of at least $1,650 for individuals or $3,300 for families).

### The Triple Tax Advantage

Here is what makes the HSA extraordinary. It is the only account in the U.S. tax code that offers a **triple tax advantage**:

1. **Tax-free contributions** -- money goes in before taxes, reducing your taxable income (just like a Traditional 401(k)).
2. **Tax-free growth** -- your investments grow without being taxed (just like a Roth IRA).
3. **Tax-free withdrawals** -- when you spend the money on qualified medical expenses, you pay zero tax on the way out.

No other account gives you all three. A Traditional 401(k) gives you #1 and #2 but taxes you on withdrawals. A Roth IRA gives you #2 and #3 but taxes you on contributions. The HSA gives you all three.

### HSA Contribution Limits for 2025

| | Individual | Family |
|---|---|---|
| Annual contribution limit | $4,300 | $8,550 |
| Catch-up contribution (age 55+) | +$1,000 | +$1,000 |

### The Secret HSA Strategy: Invest and Wait

Here is where the HSA gets really interesting. You do not have to spend your HSA money right away. You can pay for medical expenses out of pocket, let your HSA investments grow for decades, and then reimburse yourself later. There is no time limit on reimbursement.

The strategy:

1. **Contribute the maximum** to your HSA each year.
2. **Invest the balance** in low-cost index funds (many HSA providers offer investment options once your balance reaches a certain threshold, often $1,000-$2,000).
3. **Pay current medical bills out of pocket** if you can afford to. Save your receipts.
4. **Let the HSA grow for years or decades.**
5. **Reimburse yourself tax-free** whenever you want, using those saved receipts.

If you contribute $4,300 per year for 30 years and earn an average 7% return, your HSA could grow to over **$400,000** -- all tax-free for medical expenses. And after age 65, you can withdraw for any purpose (not just medical) and pay only regular income tax, similar to a Traditional IRA. No penalty.

!!! tip "Keep Your Receipts"
    If you use the invest-and-wait strategy, save every medical receipt in a folder (digital is fine). You can reimburse yourself for a doctor visit you paid for in 2025 using HSA funds in 2045. The receipt is your proof that it was a qualified expense.

## Employee Benefits: More Than Just the 401(k)

Your **employee benefits** package is a significant part of your total compensation. Many young adults focus only on salary and ignore benefits worth thousands of dollars per year. Here are the most common benefits to look for and understand:

- **Health insurance** -- employer-sponsored plans are usually much cheaper than buying insurance on your own. The employer typically pays 70-80% of the premium.
- **Dental and vision insurance** -- often inexpensive through an employer (sometimes under $20/month).
- **Life insurance** -- many employers provide free basic coverage equal to one or two times your annual salary.
- **Disability insurance** -- protects your income if you get injured or sick and cannot work. Short-term and long-term options.
- **401(k) with match** -- the free money we have been discussing.
- **HSA or FSA** -- tax-advantaged health spending accounts.
- **Employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)** -- some companies let you buy company stock at a discount, often 10-15% below market price.
- **Education benefits** -- tuition reimbursement, student loan repayment assistance, or professional development funds.
- **Paid time off (PTO)** -- vacation days, sick days, and personal days.

When evaluating a job offer, do not just compare salaries. A job paying $50,000 with a 100% match on 5% and free health insurance could be worth more than a $55,000 job with no match and expensive insurance.

---

## Open Enrollment: Your Annual Benefits Window

**Open enrollment** is the period each year (usually in the fall, around October-November) when you can sign up for, change, or cancel your employer benefits for the upcoming year. Outside of this window, you typically cannot make changes unless you have a "qualifying life event" like getting married, having a baby, or losing other coverage.

### Your Open Enrollment Checklist

Open enrollment can feel overwhelming when you get a stack of paperwork or a confusing benefits portal. Use this checklist to make sure you are covering the essentials:

- [ ] **Review your 401(k) contribution.** Are you contributing at least enough to get the full employer match? Can you afford to increase it by 1%?
- [ ] **Choose Traditional or Roth 401(k).** Revisit this decision each year as your income changes.
- [ ] **Select your health insurance plan.** Compare premiums (monthly cost), deductibles (what you pay before insurance kicks in), and out-of-pocket maximums. If you are young and healthy, a high-deductible plan with an HSA can save you money.
- [ ] **Maximize your HSA.** If you have a high-deductible plan, set your HSA contribution to the max ($4,300 individual / $8,550 family for 2025).
- [ ] **Enroll in dental and vision** if the cost is reasonable.
- [ ] **Check life and disability insurance.** The free basic coverage is usually enough for young adults without dependents, but review it.
- [ ] **Look into ESPP.** If your company offers an employee stock purchase plan with a discount, it can be a good deal. Just do not put all your eggs in one basket -- diversify.
- [ ] **Use education benefits.** If your employer offers tuition reimbursement or professional development funds, use them. Free education is free education.
- [ ] **Update your beneficiaries.** This is the person who receives your retirement accounts and life insurance if something happens to you. Keep it current.
- [ ] **Save your benefits summary.** Keep a copy of your elections so you can reference them during the year.

!!! warning "Don't Just Click Through"
    The biggest open enrollment mistake is keeping last year's elections without reviewing them. Plans change. Prices change. Your life changes. Take 30 minutes each year to review everything. Those 30 minutes could save you hundreds or thousands of dollars.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Now that you understand all the pieces, here is how 401(k) and employer benefits fit into the overall priority framework:

| Priority | Action | Why It Comes in This Order |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | Build $1,000 starter emergency fund | Basic safety net against common emergencies |
| **#2** | **Get full employer 401(k) match** | **Free money. Instant 50-100% return. Nothing else competes.** |
| #3 | Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%) | High-interest debt erodes wealth faster than investments grow |
| #4 | Build emergency fund to 3-6 months | Full financial safety net |
| #5 | Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year) | Tax-free growth in an account you fully control |
| #6 | Invest in low-cost index funds | Build long-term wealth beyond retirement accounts |
| #7 | Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%) | Clean up remaining debt |
| #8 | Save for specific goals | House down payment, travel, education |

Notice that the full employer match comes at Priority #2 -- before paying off credit card debt, before a Roth IRA, before everything else except your starter emergency fund. This is because no investment reliably delivers an instant 50-100% guaranteed return. The employer match does. If you have high-interest debt, contribute just enough to get the full match, then throw everything else at the debt.

Where does the HSA fit? If you have access to one, max it out alongside your 401(k) match at Priority #2 because of the triple tax advantage. If you cannot afford to do both, get the full 401(k) match first.

---

## Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)

**Mistake #1: Not contributing enough to get the full match.**
This is by far the most expensive mistake on this list. If your employer matches 50% on 6% and you only contribute 3%, you are leaving half the free money on the table. Always contribute at least enough to capture the full match.

**Mistake #2: Cashing out your 401(k) when you leave a job.**
You lose 30%+ to taxes and penalties, plus decades of growth. Roll it over to an IRA instead. It takes about 30 minutes and saves you tens of thousands of dollars.

**Mistake #3: Keeping the default investment in a money market fund.**
Some 401(k) plans default your contributions to a low-yield money market or stable value fund. Check your investments and make sure you are in a diversified portfolio. A target-date fund is an easy, solid choice if you are not sure.

**Mistake #4: Ignoring the HSA investment option.**
Most people treat their HSA like a checking account for doctor visits. If you can afford to pay medical expenses out of pocket, invest your HSA balance in index funds and let it grow tax-free for decades.

**Mistake #5: Not increasing contributions over time.**
Every time you get a raise, increase your 401(k) contribution by at least 1%. You will not miss money you never saw in your paycheck, and your future self will thank you.

**Mistake #6: Skipping open enrollment.**
Benefits are not "set it and forget it." Review and optimize your elections every year during open enrollment. Plans change, premiums change, and your needs change.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of the key concepts from this chapter.

**1. If your employer matches 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary, and you earn $60,000, how much free money do you get per year if you contribute 6%?**

??? note "Answer"
    $1,800 per year. You contribute 6% of $60,000 = $3,600. Your employer matches 50% of that = $1,800. That is $1,800 of free money per year.

**2. What is the 2025 401(k) employee contribution limit?**

??? note "Answer"
    $23,500 per year. This is the combined limit for Traditional and Roth 401(k) contributions.

**3. What are the three tax advantages of an HSA?**

??? note "Answer"
    Tax-free contributions (money goes in pre-tax), tax-free growth (investments are not taxed), and tax-free withdrawals (for qualified medical expenses). No other account gets all three.

**4. You have been at your company for 3 years. Your employer uses a graded vesting schedule (20% per year). You have $5,000 in employer match contributions. How much can you keep if you leave?**

??? note "Answer"
    $3,000. At 3 years, you are 60% vested. \( \$5{,}000 \times 0.60 = \$3{,}000 \). The remaining $2,000 goes back to the employer.

**5. Why is getting the full employer match Priority #2 in the financial plan, ahead of paying off high-interest debt?**

??? note "Answer"
    Because the employer match is a guaranteed, instant 50-100% return on your money. No debt payoff strategy or investment can reliably match that return. You should contribute enough to get the full match, then direct extra money toward high-interest debt.

## What To Do This Week

You have the knowledge. Now take action. Here are concrete steps to complete this week:

**Day 1-2: Find your match.**
Log into your employer's benefits portal or call HR. Find the exact match formula. Write it down: "My employer matches ___% of my contribution up to ___% of my salary."

**Day 2-3: Check your contribution.**
Are you contributing enough to get the full match? If not, log in and increase your contribution today. If you are already getting the full match, see if you can increase by 1%.

**Day 3-4: Check your investments.**
Look at what your 401(k) money is invested in. If it is sitting in a money market or stable value fund, switch to a target-date fund closest to the year you turn 65.

**Day 4-5: Check your vesting.**
Find out your vesting schedule and how much of your employer match you currently own. This is listed on your 401(k) statement or benefits portal.

**Day 5-6: Evaluate your HSA.**
If you have a high-deductible health plan, check whether you have an HSA and whether you are contributing. If you are contributing, check whether the balance is invested or just sitting in cash.

**Day 6-7: Gather your benefits summary.**
Find your most recent benefits elections and save them somewhere accessible. Note the next open enrollment date on your calendar.

You do not need to do everything perfectly right away. The single most important action is to make sure you are contributing enough to get the full employer match. That one change alone could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over your career. Do not leave free money on the table.
