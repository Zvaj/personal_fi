## Introduction: This Is Not Just for Rich Old People

Let us get something out of the way immediately. When you hear "estate planning," you probably picture a wealthy 70-year-old sitting in a lawyer's office dividing up a mansion and a stock portfolio. That image is wrong, and it keeps millions of young adults from doing something that takes a few hours and could save their families enormous pain.

**Estate planning** is simply deciding what happens to your stuff, your money, and your medical decisions if you die or become unable to make decisions for yourself. That is it. If you have a bank account, a car, a phone full of photos, or a single person you care about, you have an estate. And without a plan, the state government gets to decide what happens to all of it.

Here is the reality. You have been building something. Maybe it is a $1,000 emergency fund, a Roth IRA, a car, or just your personal belongings. Estate planning is how you make sure that if something unexpected happens, the people you choose get what you have built -- not whoever the state decides should get it.

This chapter walks you through the six things every young adult should set up. None of them are complicated. Most of them are free or low-cost. And once they are in place, you can forget about them for years at a time.

## Estate Planning Documents Everyone Needs

Before we get into the details, here is the big picture. These are the documents that form a basic estate plan, what each one does, and what it costs.

| Document | What It Does | Typical Cost | Urgency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Will | Says who gets your stuff and names a guardian for kids | $0-$300 (online tools or attorney) | High -- do this first |
| Beneficiary designations | Directs retirement accounts and insurance payouts to who you choose | $0 (free through your account provider) | High -- do this today |
| Financial power of attorney | Names someone to handle your money if you cannot | $0-$150 | High -- do this now |
| Medical power of attorney (healthcare proxy) | Names someone to make medical decisions if you cannot speak for yourself | $0-$150 | High -- do this now |
| Living will (advance directive) | States your wishes for end-of-life medical care | $0-$150 (often bundled with medical POA) | Medium -- do this soon |
| Trust | Holds your assets and transfers them without probate court | $1,000-$3,000 (attorney recommended) | Low for most young adults |

You do not need all of these right now. But you need the top four -- will, beneficiary designations, financial power of attorney, and medical power of attorney. They are the foundation of any estate plan, and they apply whether you have $500 or $5 million.

## Why You Need a Will Even at 22

A **will** is a legal document that states who gets your stuff when you die. It also lets you name a guardian for your minor children, name an executor (the person who carries out your wishes), and specify any other final wishes.

"But I am 22. I do not have anything worth fighting over." That might be true right now, but consider this scenario.

### Real Scenario: What Happens Without a Will

**Meet Jordan, age 24.** Jordan has a $3,000 savings account, a $12,000 car loan (with the car worth $9,000), a Roth IRA with $4,500, a 401(k) with $2,800 through work, a $1,200 laptop, and about $8,000 in other personal belongings. Jordan rents an apartment, is not married, but has a serious partner named Alex. Jordan's parents are divorced and do not get along.

Jordan dies unexpectedly in a car accident.

| What Happens | WITH a Will | WITHOUT a Will (Intestate) |
|---|---|---|
| Who gets the savings account? | Whoever Jordan named -- could be Alex, a parent, a sibling, or a charity | Decided by state law -- usually goes to parents (not Alex) |
| Who gets personal belongings? | Whoever Jordan specified | Parents (by default in most states) |
| Who handles Jordan's affairs? | The executor Jordan chose | A court-appointed administrator -- could be anyone |
| Does Alex get anything? | Whatever Jordan specified | Nothing, unless the state recognizes common-law marriage (most do not) |
| How long does the process take? | A few weeks to a few months | Months to over a year (probate court) |
| Family conflict? | Minimized -- Jordan's wishes are clear | High risk -- parents vs. Alex, divorced parents fighting |
| Cost to settle? | Lower -- clear instructions | Higher -- court fees, legal costs, potential disputes |

Without a will, your state's "intestacy laws" decide everything. In most states, if you are single with no children, everything goes to your parents. If your parents are deceased, it goes to siblings. If you are married, your spouse gets most or all of it, but the specifics vary by state.

Notice who is not on that list: your partner (unless married), your best friend, your favorite charity, or the specific sibling you actually wanted to have your things. Without a will, your wishes do not matter. The state's default rules take over.

### How to Create a Will

You have three main options, ranging from free to a few hundred dollars.

**Option 1: Online will-making tools ($0-$150).** Services like FreeWill (free, donation-supported), Trust & Will ($159), or LegalZoom ($89-$249) walk you through a guided process. You answer questions, the tool generates a legal document, and you sign it with witnesses. This is good enough for most young adults with straightforward situations.

**Option 2: Estate planning attorney ($200-$1,000).** An attorney drafts a customized will and can handle more complex situations -- blended families, business ownership, property in multiple states. Worth considering if your situation is complicated, but not necessary for most 20-somethings.

**Option 3: Handwritten (holographic) will ($0).** Some states recognize handwritten wills that are entirely in your handwriting, dated, and signed. This is better than nothing, but it is the weakest option legally and not valid in every state.

!!! tip "Good Enough Beats Perfect"
    A basic will from an online tool is infinitely better than no will at all. Do not let the pursuit of a "perfect" legal document stop you from creating one. You can always update it later as your life changes.

## Beneficiary Designations: The Override Button

A **beneficiary designation** is a form you fill out on certain financial accounts -- like your 401(k), Roth IRA, life insurance policy, and sometimes bank accounts -- that names who receives the money in that account when you die.

Here is the critical thing to understand: **beneficiary designations override your will.** Read that again. If your will says "everything goes to my sister" but your 401(k) beneficiary designation still lists your ex-partner from three years ago, your ex gets the 401(k) money. The will does not matter for that account. The beneficiary designation wins every time.

This is one of the most common and most painful estate planning mistakes. People update their will after a divorce or breakup but forget to update the beneficiary on their retirement accounts and life insurance. The result is that money goes to exactly the wrong person, and there is almost nothing anyone can do about it.

### Accounts That Use Beneficiary Designations

- **401(k) and 403(b) plans** -- your employer retirement accounts
- **Traditional and Roth IRAs** -- your individual retirement accounts
- **Life insurance policies** -- the death benefit payout
- **Pension plans** -- if you have one
- **Bank accounts** -- you can add a "payable on death" (POD) designation
- **Brokerage accounts** -- you can add a "transfer on death" (TOD) designation
- **HSA (Health Savings Account)** -- if you have one

For each account, you name a **primary beneficiary** (the first person who gets the money) and a **contingent beneficiary** (the backup, in case your primary beneficiary has also died). Always name both.

!!! warning "Update Your Beneficiaries After Every Major Life Event"
    Got married? Update. Got divorced? Update. Had a baby? Update. Lost a parent? Update. This takes five minutes per account. Log in, find the beneficiary section, and verify or change the names. Do not assume it is still correct just because you set it up once.

### How to Set Up Beneficiary Designations

1. **Log into each account** (401(k), IRA, life insurance, bank accounts).
2. **Find the beneficiary section.** It is usually under "Account Settings," "Profile," or "Beneficiaries." If you cannot find it, call the institution.
3. **Name your primary beneficiary** with their full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, and relationship to you.
4. **Name a contingent beneficiary** -- your backup.
5. **Save and confirm.** Some accounts require a physical signature or notarization for changes. Your 401(k) may require your spouse's written consent to name anyone other than your spouse as beneficiary (this is a federal law called ERISA).

This entire process costs $0 and takes about 30 minutes if you do all your accounts at once.

## Power of Attorney: Who Speaks for You When You Cannot

A **power of attorney** (POA) is a legal document that gives someone you trust the authority to act on your behalf. There are two types every adult needs.

### Financial Power of Attorney

A financial power of attorney authorizes someone to manage your money and finances if you become unable to do so. This person (called your "agent" or "attorney-in-fact") can pay your bills, access your bank accounts, manage investments, file taxes, and handle other financial matters on your behalf.

**Why you need this even at 22:** Imagine you are in a serious accident and spend two weeks unconscious in the hospital. Your rent is due. Your car payment is due. Your phone bill is due. Without a financial power of attorney, nobody -- not your parents, not your partner, not your best friend -- can legally access your bank account to pay these bills. They would have to go to court to get that authority, which takes weeks and costs money.

A financial power of attorney can be "durable," meaning it stays in effect even if you become incapacitated (unable to make decisions). This is the type you want. A non-durable power of attorney ends if you become incapacitated, which defeats the purpose for estate planning.

### Medical Power of Attorney (Healthcare Proxy)

A medical power of attorney (also called a healthcare proxy or healthcare agent) names someone to make medical decisions for you if you cannot communicate or make decisions yourself. This includes decisions about treatment options, surgery, medications, and in extreme cases, end-of-life care.

**Why this matters for young adults:** Once you turn 18, your parents no longer have automatic legal authority to make medical decisions for you. If you are in a hospital bed unable to speak, the doctors cannot legally take direction from your mom, your dad, or your partner unless you have a document that says they can.

This surprises most people. You might assume your parents can step in, but legally they cannot without a healthcare proxy in place. Hospitals take this seriously, and family members have been shut out of medical decisions because no paperwork existed.

### Living Will (Advance Directive)

A **living will** (also called an advance directive) is a document that states your wishes for end-of-life medical care. It answers questions like: Do you want to be kept on life support if you are in a permanent vegetative state? Do you want CPR if your heart stops? Do you want a feeding tube?

Nobody wants to think about this at 24. But if you do not write it down, your family has to guess -- and that guessing can tear families apart during an already devastating time. A living will removes the burden of those impossible decisions from the people you love.

A living will and a medical power of attorney are often created together as part of an "advance directive" package. Many states offer free forms you can download and fill out.

</details>

The flowchart above shows that almost every adult needs at least four documents: a will, beneficiary designations, a medical power of attorney, and a financial power of attorney. Trusts are helpful but not urgent for most young adults.

## Trusts: When They Make Sense

A **trust** is a legal arrangement where you transfer ownership of your assets to a separate legal entity (the trust), managed by a person you name (the trustee), for the benefit of the people you choose (the beneficiaries). When you die, the assets in the trust pass directly to your beneficiaries without going through probate court.

That definition probably sounds confusing, so here is a simpler way to think about it. A trust is like a locked box. You put your stuff inside the box, write instructions on who gets what, and hand the key to someone you trust. When you die, the person with the key opens the box and distributes everything according to your instructions -- no court, no public record, no delays.

### Why Trusts Exist: Avoiding Probate

**Probate** is the legal process a court uses to validate your will, pay your debts, and distribute your assets after you die. Probate is public (anyone can look up the details), slow (often 6-18 months), and expensive (typically 2-7% of the estate value in legal and court fees).

A trust avoids probate entirely. Assets in a trust pass directly to your beneficiaries -- privately, quickly, and at much lower cost.

### Do You Need a Trust Right Now?

For most young adults in their 20s, **probably not.** A will and beneficiary designations handle most situations. Trusts make more sense when:

- You own real estate (especially in multiple states)
- You have more than $100,000 in assets outside of retirement accounts
- You want privacy (wills are public after probate; trusts are private)
- You have minor children and want detailed control over how money is managed for them
- You have a blended family or complicated family dynamics
- You own a business

If none of these apply to you today, a will is enough. As your wealth grows and your life gets more complex, you can add a trust later. But it is good to understand what trusts do so you know when the time is right.

### The Two Main Types of Trusts

- **Revocable living trust**: You can change or cancel it at any time while you are alive. You maintain full control of the assets. This is the most common type for estate planning. When you die, it becomes irrevocable (cannot be changed) and distributes assets according to your instructions.

- **Irrevocable trust**: Once created, you cannot change it without the beneficiaries' consent. You give up control of the assets. In exchange, those assets may be protected from creditors and may have estate tax benefits. This is more relevant for people with very large estates.

For young adults, if and when you need a trust, it will almost certainly be a revocable living trust. But again, most people in their 20s do not need one yet.

## Digital Asset Planning: Your Online Life Has Value

**Digital asset planning** is the process of organizing, documenting, and deciding what happens to your online accounts, digital files, cryptocurrency, and other digital property when you die or become incapacitated.

This is the part of estate planning that did not exist 20 years ago and is now one of the most important pieces for young adults. Think about how much of your life exists only online.

### What Counts as a Digital Asset?

Your digital footprint is probably larger than you realize. Here are the categories to think about.

| Category | Examples | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Financial accounts | Online banking, Venmo, PayPal, Cash App, cryptocurrency wallets | These hold real money that someone needs to access |
| Investment accounts | Brokerage accounts, crypto exchanges (Coinbase, etc.) | Could hold significant value |
| Email accounts | Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo | Gateway to resetting passwords on every other account |
| Social media | Instagram, TikTok, X, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube | Memorialization or deletion preferences |
| Subscriptions | Spotify, Netflix, gym memberships, software subscriptions | Need to be cancelled to stop charges |
| Cloud storage | Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox | May contain important documents, photos, memories |
| Digital purchases | Kindle books, iTunes, Steam games, app purchases | May have monetary or sentimental value |
| Cryptocurrency | Bitcoin, Ethereum, other tokens in wallets | Can be permanently lost without access keys |
| Domain names and websites | Personal websites, blogs, side business sites | May have financial or sentimental value |
| Loyalty programs | Airline miles, hotel points, credit card rewards | Can be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars |

### The Cryptocurrency Problem

Cryptocurrency deserves special attention because of one critical difference from traditional financial accounts: **if nobody knows your private keys or recovery phrase, your crypto is gone forever.** There is no bank to call. There is no "forgot password" option. There is no customer service.

An estimated $140 billion in Bitcoin alone is permanently lost, much of it because owners died without sharing access information. If you hold any cryptocurrency, your estate plan must include a secure way for someone to access your keys.

This does not mean writing your seed phrase on a sticky note on your monitor. It means storing it securely (a sealed envelope in a safe deposit box, a hardware device with instructions, or an encrypted digital file with the decryption key stored separately) and making sure your executor or a trusted person knows where to find it.

### Creating a Digital Asset Inventory

The most important step in digital asset planning is creating an inventory. You do not need to share every password right now. You need a single document that tells someone where to look and how to get in.

Here is a template to start with.

| Account / Asset | Provider | Username / Email | Where Password Is Stored | Instructions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primary email | Gmail | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Use to reset other accounts |
| Checking account | Chase | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Primary bank account |
| Roth IRA | Fidelity | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Beneficiary: Mom |
| 401(k) | Vanguard | Through employer | Password manager | Beneficiary: Mom |
| Crypto wallet | Ledger hardware wallet | N/A | Seed phrase in safe deposit box | DO NOT lose seed phrase |
| Coinbase | Coinbase | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Exchange account |
| Instagram | Instagram | @jordan | Password manager | Memorialize or delete |
| Spotify | Spotify | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Cancel subscription |
| Netflix | Netflix | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Cancel subscription |
| Domain name | Namecheap | jordan@gmail.com | Password manager | Renew or let expire |
| iCloud | Apple | jordan@icloud.com | Password manager | Photos, documents -- download for family |

**Where to store this inventory:**

- A password manager (like 1Password, Bitwarden, or LastPass) is the best central tool. Store all your passwords there, then share the master password with one trusted person.
- Keep a physical backup in a fireproof safe or safe deposit box.
- Do not store everything in a single unencrypted document on your computer.
- Update the inventory once a year or whenever you create a new important account.

!!! note "Social Media Legacy Settings"
    Most major platforms now have legacy or memorialization options. Facebook lets you choose a "legacy contact" who can manage your profile after you die. Google has an "Inactive Account Manager" that can share your data or delete your account after a period of inactivity. Apple has a "Digital Legacy" program. Set these up now -- it takes five minutes per platform and saves your family the anguish of trying to deal with your accounts without any authority.

Start with the highest-urgency items: beneficiary designations on your retirement accounts and a basic will. Then work through the power of attorney documents, digital asset inventory, and the rest. You do not have to finish everything in one sitting.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Basic Estate Planning

Here is the complete process, in order, with estimated time and cost for each step.

**Step 1: Set beneficiary designations on all accounts (30 minutes, $0).**
Log into every financial account you have -- 401(k), IRA, life insurance, bank accounts, brokerage accounts. Name a primary beneficiary and a contingent (backup) beneficiary on each one. This is the single most impactful thing you can do.

**Step 2: Create a basic will (1-2 hours, $0-$300).**
Use an online tool like FreeWill, Trust & Will, or LegalZoom. Decide who gets your stuff, who handles your affairs (your executor), and if you have kids, who becomes their guardian. Print the will, sign it in front of two witnesses (requirements vary by state), and store it safely.

**Step 3: Complete a medical power of attorney (30 minutes, $0-$150).**
Many states offer free forms online. Name someone you trust to make medical decisions for you. Tell that person you have named them and discuss your general wishes. This is critical -- without it, your family may not be able to make medical decisions for you after you turn 18.

**Step 4: Complete a financial power of attorney (30 minutes, $0-$150).**
Same process. Name someone to handle your finances if you cannot. This is often the same person as your medical POA, but it does not have to be.

**Step 5: Create a living will (30 minutes, $0-$150).**
State your wishes for end-of-life medical care. This is often included in the same package as your medical POA.

**Step 6: Build your digital asset inventory (1-2 hours, $0).**
Use the template above. List every important digital account, where the password is stored, and basic instructions. Store this inventory securely and tell one trusted person where to find it.

**Step 7: Store everything safely.**
Your original will, power of attorney documents, and living will should be stored in a fireproof safe or safe deposit box. Give copies to your executor, your POA agents, and your attorney (if you have one). Do not store originals only in a safe deposit box -- in some states, the box is sealed when you die and requires a court order to open.

**Step 8: Tell people.**
This is the step most people skip. Tell your executor, your POA agents, and at least one close family member that these documents exist and where to find them. The best estate plan in the world is useless if nobody knows about it.

**Total time: approximately 4-6 hours. Total cost: $0-$500.**

That is it. An afternoon of work now saves your family weeks or months of stress, thousands of dollars in legal fees, and the anguish of guessing what you would have wanted.

## Where Your Money Should Go: The Priority Framework

Estate planning fits into your broader financial plan. Here is how it connects to the priority framework you have been following throughout this course.

1. **Build $1,000 starter emergency fund** -- Your first line of defense.
2. **Get your full employer 401(k) match** -- Free money. Set beneficiary designations on your 401(k) while you are at it.
3. **Pay off high-interest debt (over 7%)** -- Credit cards, payday loans.
4. **Build emergency fund to 3-6 months of expenses** -- Your full safety net.
5. **Max out Roth IRA ($7,000/year in 2025)** -- Tax-free retirement growth. Set beneficiary designations on your IRA.
6. **Invest in low-cost index funds** -- Long-term wealth building.
7. **Pay off medium-interest debt (4-7%)** -- Car loans, some student loans.
8. **Save for specific goals** -- House down payment, wedding, etc.

**Where does estate planning fit?** Like insurance, estate planning is not a numbered priority -- it is something you do alongside the financial priorities listed above. The moment you open a retirement account (Priority #2 or #5), you should set your beneficiary designations. Once you have any assets worth protecting, you should create a basic will and power of attorney documents.

Estate planning does not cost much and does not take much time. But its absence can undo years of smart financial decisions in a matter of weeks. The money you save and invest is only as secure as the plan that protects it.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Thinking estate planning is only for wealthy or old people.** If you have a bank account, a car, a retirement account, or anyone who depends on you, you need an estate plan. A 23-year-old with a $3,000 savings account and a $5,000 Roth IRA still needs beneficiary designations, a will, and power of attorney documents. Estate planning is about protecting people, not just assets.

**Mistake #2: Forgetting to update beneficiary designations after life changes.** Your 401(k) beneficiary form from your first job might still list your college roommate, your ex, or nobody at all. Beneficiary designations override your will. If they are out of date, the wrong person gets your money, and your will cannot fix it.

**Mistake #3: Not having a medical power of attorney.** The moment you turn 18, your parents lose automatic legal authority to make medical decisions for you. If you are in the hospital and cannot speak for yourself, doctors may not be able to take direction from anyone unless you have this document. It takes 15 minutes to create and could be the most important form you ever fill out.

**Mistake #4: Keeping your estate plan a secret.** A will locked in a safe that nobody knows about is nearly as useless as no will at all. Tell your executor, your POA agents, and at least one family member that these documents exist and where to find them.

**Mistake #5: Ignoring digital assets.** If you hold cryptocurrency and die without sharing your private keys, that money is gone forever. If you have 15 active subscriptions and nobody knows the passwords, your estate bleeds money every month. A digital asset inventory takes an hour to create and solves both problems.

**Mistake #6: Paying thousands for a trust you do not need yet.** Trusts are valuable tools, but most young adults with simple financial situations do not need one. A will, beneficiary designations, and power of attorney documents handle 90% of what you need. You can always add a trust later as your wealth grows. Do not let a financial advisor upsell you on something you are not ready for.

## Quick Quiz

Test your understanding of estate planning.

??? question "1. Why do beneficiary designations on retirement accounts matter more than what your will says?"
    **Beneficiary designations override your will.** If your will says everything goes to your sister, but your 401(k) beneficiary still lists your ex-partner, your ex gets the 401(k) money. The will does not apply to accounts with beneficiary designations. Always keep your beneficiaries up to date on every account.

??? question "2. Jordan is 22, single, and just opened a Roth IRA. What estate planning steps should Jordan take right now?"
    **At minimum:** Set a beneficiary designation on the Roth IRA, create a basic will (even a free online one), set up a medical power of attorney (since parents no longer have automatic authority after 18), and set up a financial power of attorney. Jordan should also create a digital asset inventory. Total cost: $0-$300. Total time: a few hours.

??? question "3. What happens to your medical decisions after you turn 18 if you do not have a healthcare proxy?"
    **Your parents lose automatic authority to make medical decisions for you.** If you are hospitalized and cannot speak for yourself, doctors may not be able to take direction from your parents, partner, or anyone else without a medical power of attorney (healthcare proxy) on file. This is true even if you are 18 and still living at home.

??? question "4. What is probate, and how does a trust help you avoid it?"
    **Probate is the court process that validates your will, pays your debts, and distributes your assets after death.** It is public, slow (6-18 months), and expensive (2-7% of estate value). A trust avoids probate because assets in the trust pass directly to beneficiaries without going through court. However, most young adults do not need a trust -- a will is sufficient for simple estates.

??? question "5. Why is cryptocurrency a special concern in estate planning?"
    **If nobody knows your private keys or recovery phrase, your cryptocurrency is permanently lost.** There is no bank to call, no customer service, and no password reset. An estimated $140 billion in Bitcoin is permanently inaccessible. If you hold crypto, your estate plan must include secure storage of your keys and instructions for someone you trust to access them.

??? question "6. How often should you review and update your estate plan?"
    **At minimum, after every major life event:** marriage, divorce, birth of a child, death of a beneficiary, significant change in assets, or a move to a new state (laws vary by state). Even without major changes, review your beneficiary designations and documents every one to two years to make sure everything is still accurate.

## Key Terms

- **Estate Planning**: The process of organizing your legal and financial documents to determine what happens to your assets, medical decisions, and dependents if you die or become incapacitated. It is not just for wealthy or elderly people -- every adult with a bank account, belongings, or people they care about should have a basic estate plan in place.

- **Will**: A legal document that states who receives your assets when you die, names an executor to carry out your wishes, and can designate a guardian for minor children. Without a will, your state's intestacy laws determine who gets everything, which may not match your wishes. Can be created for free or at low cost using online tools.

- **Beneficiary Designation**: A form filed with a financial institution (401(k), IRA, life insurance, bank account) that names who receives the money in that account when you die. Critically, beneficiary designations override your will. If the designation says one thing and your will says another, the designation wins. Must be updated after every major life event.

- **Power of Attorney**: A legal document that gives a person you choose (your "agent") the authority to act on your behalf. A financial power of attorney lets your agent manage your money and pay bills. A medical power of attorney (healthcare proxy) lets your agent make medical decisions for you. Both are essential because once you turn 18, no one -- not even your parents -- has automatic authority to act on your behalf.

- **Trust**: A legal arrangement where you transfer ownership of assets to a separate entity (the trust), managed by a trustee, for the benefit of named beneficiaries. Assets in a trust bypass probate court, passing directly and privately to beneficiaries. A revocable living trust is the most common type. Most young adults with simple finances do not need a trust yet, but it becomes valuable as wealth and complexity grow.

- **Digital Asset Planning**: The process of documenting and organizing your online accounts, digital files, cryptocurrency, subscriptions, and social media presence so they can be accessed, transferred, or closed by someone you trust after your death or incapacity. Includes creating a digital asset inventory, storing passwords securely, and ensuring cryptocurrency keys are recoverable.

## What To Do This Week

Here is your action plan. Work through these steps in order.

- [ ] **Day 1**: Log into every retirement account you have (401(k), Roth IRA, Traditional IRA) and check your beneficiary designations. If they are blank, outdated, or list the wrong person, update them today. This takes 10-15 minutes per account and is the single most important estate planning step.
- [ ] **Day 2**: Check beneficiary designations on your life insurance policy (if you have one), bank accounts (add a "payable on death" designation), and any brokerage accounts (add "transfer on death"). All free, all take minutes.
- [ ] **Day 3**: Create a basic will using a free online tool like FreeWill or a paid service like Trust & Will. It takes about an hour. Decide who gets your stuff, who your executor is, and if you have kids, who becomes their guardian. Print it and sign it with two witnesses.
- [ ] **Day 4**: Complete a medical power of attorney (healthcare proxy). Search "[your state] medical power of attorney free form" to find your state's version. Name someone you trust. Tell that person you have named them.
- [ ] **Day 5**: Complete a financial power of attorney. Same process. Name someone to handle your finances if you are incapacitated. This can be the same person as your healthcare proxy or someone different.
- [ ] **Weekend**: Build your digital asset inventory. Use the template in this chapter. List every important account, where the password is stored, and what should happen to each one. Store it in your password manager and tell one trusted person the master password. Set up legacy contacts on Facebook, Google, and Apple.

Estate planning is not about being morbid. It is about being responsible. You spend hours researching which index fund to buy or which credit card has the best rewards. Spend one afternoon making sure all of that work is protected. The people you care about will be grateful you did.
